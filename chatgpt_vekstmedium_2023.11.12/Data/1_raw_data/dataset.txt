1	Leaf rust resistance genes in Aegilops genus: occurrence and efficiency	Leaf rust is a common and costly wheat disease. The introduction of resistance genes derived from wheat wild relatives is one way to improve disease control. However, due to the rapid development of virulence in the casual pathogen Puccinia triticina, the long-term effectiveness of some leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes is questionable. To assess this, we examined 130 accessions of 13 wheat wild relative species from the Aegilops genus. The presence of 9 Lr genes was determined by PCR using primers complementary to Lr gene markers. The studied individuals were exposed to artificial inoculation with P. triticina under greenhouse and field conditions, respectively. Based on infection rate, the degree of resistance for each individual was estimated. The relationship between the presence of Lr genes and the degree of manifested resistance was assessed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Our results indicate the effective participation of Lr9 in seedling resistance while Lr58 is involved in adult plant resistance.
2	Seedling and adult plant resistance to leaf rust in some Bulgarian common wheat lines	"The response of 250 common winter wheat breeding lines was investigated for resistance to the causative agent of Puccinia triticina under conditions of an infected field on the territory of Dobrudzha Agricultural Institute - General Toshevo, Bulgaria, during three successive seasons. Twenty lines with different degrees of resistance under field conditions were selected. Multi-pathotype testing was used to study the response of these lines at seedling stage under greenhouse conditions to individual pathotypes of P. triticina. Based on the response of the lines at seedling and adult stages, we found out that 20% of them carried race-specific resistance. One of the lines (99/08-52) reacted with full resistance to the pathotypes used under greenhouse conditions. The reaction demonstrated by this line coincided with the response of isogenic lines carrying the genes Lr9, Lr19, Lr22a, Lr22b and Lr25. The other three lines (19/06- 108, 82/08-43 and 82/08-35) showed a resistant reaction to 6 or 5 of the pathotypes used in the study. Their response partially coincided with the reaction of 5 isogenic lines, and the presence of some of these genes in the above lines is quite possible. Lines carrying this type of resistance are to be subjected to further genetic and breeding investigations to prove the presence of a race-specific gene. Twenty-five percent of the lines combined partial race-specific resistance at seedling stage with the resistance of race non-specific nature at adult stage. Forty percent of all studied lines carried race non-specific resistance, and 15% of the lines possessed resistance of the ""slow rusting"" type. As a result of the study we carried out, the lines that demonstrated stable resistance to leaf rust can provide sufficient protection of the host and can be included in the breeding programs for developing varieties resistant to P. triticina."
3	5'-UTR allelic variants and expression of the lycopene-T-cyclase LCYE gene in maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines of Russian selection	In breeding, biofortification is aimed at enriching the edible parts of the plant with micronutrients. Within the framework of this strategy, molecular screening of collections of various crops makes it possible to determine allelic variants of genes, new alleles, and the linkage of allelic variants with morphophysiological traits. The maize (Zea mays L.) is an important cereal and silage crop, as well as a source of the main precursor of vitamin A - beta-carotene, a derivative of the beta,beta-branch of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. The parallel beta,T-branch is triggered by lycopene-T-cyclase LCYE, a low expression of which leads to an increase in provitamin A content and is associated with the variability of the 5'-UTR gene regulatory sequence. In this study, we screened a collection of 165 maize inbred lines of Russian selection for 5'- UTR LCYE allelic variants, as well as searched for the dependence of LCYE expression levels on the 5'-UTR allelic variant in the leaves of 14 collection lines. 165 lines analyzed were divided into three groups carrying alleles A2 (64 lines), A5 (31) and A6 (70), respectively. Compared to A2, allele A5 contained two deletions (at positions -267- 260 and -296-290 from the ATG codon) and a G251T substitution, while allele A6 contained one deletion (-290-296) and two SNPs (G251T, G265T). Analysis of LCYE expression in the leaf tissue of seedlings from accessions of 14 lines differing in allelic variants showed no associations of the 5'-UTR LCYE allele type with the level of gene expression. Four lines carrying alleles A2 (6178-1, 6709-2, 2289-3) and A5 (5677) had a significantly higher level of LCYE gene expression (~0.018-0.037) than the other 10 analyzed lines (~0.0001-0.004), among which all three allelic variants were present.
4	Comparative analysis of growth and yield parameters of grape var. 'Muscat Hamburg' grafted on 'Dog Ridge' rootstock and self-rooted cuttings	India ranks seventh in grape production at the global level. Tamil Nadu is one of the leading states in grape cultivation in India. The utilization of rootstock has become a priority aspect in grapes cultivation worldwide, especially in the current climatic conditions. The utilization of grape root stocks has not been completely explored yet in Tamil Nadu. In this regard, we compared the growth and yield parameters of grape (Vitis vinifera) var. ''Muscat Hamburg'' grafted on 'Dog Ridge' (Vitis champini) and self-rooted cuttings(of ''Muscat Hamburg'') under Cumbum valley condition, Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India. Randomly, fifty vines were chosen, each in grafted and self-rooted cutting category. 'Muscat Hamburg' is a wide variety in Cumbum valley of Theni district. The growth and yield characters were recorded. The petiole nutrient content for major elements during the flowering phase was analyzed. The growth characters viz., trunk diameter (42.46 mm), cane diameter (5.70 mm), number of fruitful shoots per cane (1.37), shoot length after pruning (42.52 cm), and leaf area (108.16 cm<sup>2</sup>) were recorded maximum in 'Muscat Hamburg' grafted on 'Dog Ridge' rootstock. The grafted 'Muscat Hamburg'on 'Dog Ridge' showed the highest berry weight (3.67 g), and the number of clusters per shoot (1.46). The yield characters, viz., the fruitfulness characters, such as the number of fruitful shoots per cane (1.37) was recorded better in 'Muscat Hamburg' grafted on 'Dog Ridge' rootstock. The total number of berries per bunch (87.00), and yield per vine (21.87 kg/vine) were recorded as the highest in grafted vines. Obviously, when berry weight was the highest in grafted type, it reflected in bunch weight (276.74 g) with a maximum amount than self-rooted. The petiole nutrient contents were also found to be higher in grafted ones than in self-rooted cuttings. Overall, the use of 'Dog Ridge' as rootstock for grape variety 'Muscat Hamburg' was found promising to set enhanced vegetative growth, berry characters, and yield of the bunch than self-rooted cutting.
5	Feasibility of using a silicon preparation to promote growth of forest seedlings: application to pine (Pinus sylvestris) and oak (Quercus robur)	The present study was inspired by scientific reports describing the positive effects of silicon preparations on fruit and vegetables in horticulture. The use of silicon preparations in forest protection represents a new research application, especially in the cases of oak seedlings that are damaged by oak powdery mildew. Additionally, these preparations increase the photosynthetic efficiency of the seedlings, and thus promote increased biomass and better nutritional value of the root systems. The new idea of using silicon formulations in forestry, based on the initial test results, is particularly important for seedlings in the post-planting period in forest plantations. In particular, these preparations increase yield and plant growth, and improve plant health. So far, no comparable studies have been conducted on forest tree species. To this end, one year-old pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and two year-old English oak (Quercus robur L.) seedlings were sprayed with silicon preparations of different concentrations, and changes in growth parameters and photosynthetic efficiency were observed. The main objective of the study was to determine the effect of the silicon preparation on the seedlings during their first life span, i.e., the first year after planting. In this study, 50 pine and 50 oak seedlings were sprayed three times with the silicon preparation, in five variants (control; concentrations of 1%, 2%, 3% and 5%), as well as the chlorophyll fluorescence, height, thickness and biomass of the roots, were measured. It was found that the treatment with a concentration of 2% was better and statistically, significantly different from the other variants, e.g., in terms of increasing photosynthetic efficiency.
6	Short-term growth response of young pine (Pinus silvestris) seedlings to the different types of soil media mixture with phosphogypsum formulations under Poland forest environmental conditions	"The production of phosphoric acid produces ""waste heaps"" that have not yet been tapped, but which have the character of weak fertilizers and can perhaps be reintroduced into the elemental cycle in the forests. Two variants of mixing with organic ash and with sewage sludge were carried out. One-year-old pine seedlings (Pinus sylvestris L.) from the Trzebiez forest district (northern Poland) were planted in pots with soil that also came from the same field. Preparations containing phosphogypsum were applied topically to the soil in four doses (1, 2, 3 and 5 t/ha). The trial, which lasted one growing season, was conducted in four replicates. At the end of the trial, the height of the above-ground parts and root length, needle and root area, root neck diameter and photosynthetic performance were measured. The phosphogypsum-based preparations used showed no harmful (toxic) effects on the potted pine seedlings during the six-month trial period. The loosely prepared preparation made from a mixture of phosphogypsum and organic ash began to have a positive effect on the development of the seedlings' root system, and it was also easier to mix with the soil surface than phosphogypsum with sewage sludge, which also contained a sticky form. The photosynthetic performance of one-year-old pine seedlings decreased after one growing season following the application of phosphogypsum preparations and most of the growth parameters tested did not differ from the control, so observations over a longer period (at least two to three growing seasons) are required. However, dosages of 1 and 2 t/ha seem to be the most promising, and these lower dosages are more economical to manage in nurseries or plantations, especially on poor sites. Formulations should be tested for heavy metals and their effects on seedling development. Testing should also be continued to monitor changes in the microbiome."
7	Effect of the varying inclusion levels of the egg yolk powder on growth, stress tolerance, and pigmentation of Guppy (Poecilia reticulata)	The newly hatched nauplii of Artemia is extensively used as a live feed for ornamental fish hatchlings; however, its high cost and unbalanced nutrients necessitate exploring sustainable alternatives. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of four formulated diets of 0%,5%, 10%, and 20% inclusion levels of egg yolk powder and other ingredients (fish meal, soybean meal, rice polish, corn) during the nursery stage of Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) compared to Artemia salina as a control. Results showed that survival did not differ (P > 0.05) among the diets. Weight gain, daily weight gain, and specific growth rate of the fry fed with 10% egg yolk-included diet containing 49.6% fish meal and 18.8% soybean meal were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the other test diets and the A. salina. All the diets showed higher stress indexes (P < 0.05) than the control; the test diets did not affect pigmentation.
8	Growth-survival trade-offs and the restoration of non-forested open ecosystems	The growth-survival trade-off has been extensively documented for phanerophyte species, whereas there is little evidence for non-phanerophyte species. However, information on the growth-survival trade-offs in non-phanerophyte species could be of great use in non-forested open ecosystem restoration by providing insights for plant production and transplantation, thus impacting the planning of cost-effective restoration actions. In this study, we explored the relationship between growth and survival of individual plants of non-phanerophyte species used in a coastal dune restoration project, and we investigated whether plant functional traits explained patterns of trade-off between growth and survival. We monitored 355 individual plants of 13 perennial non-phanerophyte species belonging to foredune and transition dune communities every 30 days after planting and calculated relative growth and survival rates. In addition, we regressed the relationship between growth and survival on values of leaf and floral traits. We found that, besides being a widely recognised axis of life history variation in phanerophyte species, the growth-survival trade-off can also be observed in perennial non-phanerophyte species. Species of different coastal dune communities (i.e., foredune vs. transition dune communities) differed with respect to the growth-survival trade-off, with plant species of foredune communities exhibiting higher growth but lower survival rates than plant species of transition dune communities. Leaf dry matter content and mean number of floral displays explained species position on the growth-survival trade-off axis; species with relatively high growth and low survival rates exhibited an acquisitive strategy, with low values of leaf dry matter content, but also a low sexual reproductive effort, as revealed by low number of floral displays. In contrast, plant species with relatively low growth and high survival rates exhibited a conservative strategy but also high sexual reproductive effort, suggesting that trade-offs occur in resource allocation among vegetative and reproductive plant structures. The trade-off we found between growth and survival in perennial non-phanerophyte species provides useful insights for planning cost-effective ecosystem restoration actions of non-forested open ecosystems, especially when the actions are nature-based and involve planting individual plants. The results of this study suggest that individual plant production for coastal dune restoration should disproportionately target plant species of foredune communities because they have low survival rates associated with low sexual reproductive effort. Planning plant production based on ecological knowledge of plant species' growth and survival after planting in the field could help achieve restoration goals while meeting project cost-effectiveness requirements.
9	Rapid faunal colonization and recovery of biodiversity and functional diversity following eelgrass restoration	Seagrass meadows and their associated biodiverse assemblages have declined globally due to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. Restoration of these critical habitats has the potential to reverse coastal biodiversity loss. Here, we tested the role of patch size (which can affect recruitment, food availability, and/or predation) in driving faunal colonization in an eelgrass (Zostera marina) restoration trial in Sweden. Eelgrass shoots were transplanted in plots with different configurations (continuous vs. checkerboard patterns with three patch sizes), and we followed invertebrate colonization (biodiversity and functional diversity) during the first two growing seasons. We found rapid faunal colonization following the transplantation of eelgrass shoots in all plots with invertebrate densities reaching 50-80% of the reference meadow after only one growing season (3 months). After two growing seasons (15 months), the faunal density, biodiversity, and functional diversity were similar to the reference meadow, despite eelgrass density and biomass still being lower than the reference meadow. Biodiversity, functional diversity, and community structure were similar among the different planted plots, that is, there was no indication that patch size influenced faunal colonization. We therefore consider that smaller patches embedded within larger restoration plots can be as effective for promoting biodiversity as continuous patches, with reduced costs and fewer shoots required. We also noted high natural variability between years both in the reference meadow and planted plots, showing the dynamic nature of seagrass ecosystems, and the importance of a well-planned monitoring scheme that considers the reference area and restored area within the same temporal scale.
10	Regeneration of Pinus sibirica Du Tour as a result of trophic relationships with the thin-billed nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes macrorhynchos Brehm C L)	Identifying the patterns of dynamics of natural populations of woody plants at the stage of their renewal is one of the main problems of forest ecology. The reforestation process is determined by both the dynamics of seed production and the specificity of seed dispersal of forest tree species. The five-needled pine renewal the Cembrae subsection with wingless seeds depends on birds of the genus Nucifraga sp., which store and spread their seeds. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between seed production and regeneration of Pinus sibirica Du Tour using the thin-billed nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes macrorhynchos Brehm C. L.) as a mediator. Long-term studies of these relationships have been carried out in the Siberian pine forests of the North Ural Mountains. As a result, a paradoxical conclusion is made that the number of Nucifraga birds during the period of storing and spreading of seeds in the previous year is a key factor in the abundance of Pinus sibirica seedlings. In turn, the number of seeds, both from the previous year and the current year, affects the number of Nucifraga birds.
11	Seasonal variation in cell wall composition and carbohydrate metabolism in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica growing at different depths	Posidonia oceanica is a common seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea that is able to sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon assimilated during photosynthesis can be partitioned into non-structural sugars and cell-wall polymers. In this study, we investigated the distribution of carbon in starch, soluble carbohydrates and cell-wall polymers in leaves and rhizomes of P. oceanica. Analyses were performed during summer and winter in meadows located south of the Frioul archipelago near Marseille, France. The leaves and rhizomes were isolated from plants collected in shallow (2 m) and deep water (26 m). Our results showed that P. oceanica stores more carbon as starch, sucrose and cellulose in summer and that this is more pronounced in rhizomes from deep-water plants. In winter, the reduction in photoassimilates was correlated with a lower cellulose content, compensated with a greater lignin content, except in rhizomes from deep-water plants. The syringyl-to-guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in the lignin was higher in leaves than in rhizomes and decreased in rhizomes in winter, indicating a change in the distribution or structure of the lignin. These combined data show that deep-water plants store more carbon during summer, while in winter the shallow- and deep-water plants displayed a different cell wall composition reflecting their environment.
12	Nesting behaviour and description of the larva of Alysson spinosus (Panzer, 1801) (Hymenoptera: Bembicidae)	The paper presents new data on the nesting habits of the digger wasp Alysson spinosus (Hymenoptera: Bembicidae). As food for larvae, the female provisioned about 7-8 hemipteran nymphs or imagines per cell. The collected prey belongs to two families of true hoppers (five species of Delphacidae and one species of Cicadellidae). Nests are built in sandy, shaded areas, and consist of a 10-12 cm long main burrow with 1-3 brood cells. Both sexes search for food (honeydew) on the leaves of lilac or small-leaved linden. The nests were infested by the dipteran kleptoparasitic Metopia argyrocephala (Diptera: Sarcophagidae). The mature larva is similar to that of the Nearctic Alysson melleus, from which it differs in having a blunt apical mandibular tooth and more prominent setae on the clypeus and labrum.
13	Serological, biological and molecular characterization of viruses causing mosaic diseases on cabbage (Brassica sp L.) in Central Ethiopia	"The productivity of cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) in Ethiopia has been generally low due to several biotic and abiotic constraints among which are several viral diseases. There is a recent report indicating that this economically important vegetable is seriously affected in Ethiopia by Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). However, little information exists on the incidence and distribution of these viruses as the previous report is based on samples only from Addis Ababa. In this study, a total of 370 leaf samples were collected from 75 cabbage growing fields in Central Ethiopia in two rounds of survey. Two cabbage varieties locally known as ""Habesha gomen"" and ""Tikur gomen"" with virus-like symptoms were collected and tested with Double Antibody Sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (DAS-ELISA) using polyclonal antibodies specific to CaMV and TuMV. Results from serological diagnosis were confirmed with PCR and Sanger sequencing. The results indicated a high incidence and wide distribution of both viruses in Central Ethiopia with an average of 29.5% infection for CaMV and 40% for TuMV. Biological inoculation tests for CaMV or TuMV or both on healthy cabbage seedlings gave similar symptoms as those observed in the field. Symptom severity was higher with co-infection of CaMV and TuMV followed by TuMV single infection. BLAST analysis showed that TuMV and CaMV isolates from Ethiopia have nucleotide identity of 95-98% and 93-98%, respectively to previously reported isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CaMV isolates from Ethiopia are closely related to isolates from USA and Italy within Group II clade whereas TuMV isolates have close similarities with isolates from World B clade including isolates from Kenya, UK, Japan and the Netherlands. The identification of the causative agents of the mosaic disease observed on cabbage in Central Ethiopia may lay the foundation for future management studies."
14	Effect of composition and properties of soils and soil-sand substrates contaminated with copper on morphometric parameters of barley plants	In a multifactor vegetation experiment, the effect of composition and properties of soils and soil-sand substrates contaminated with various doses of copper acetate on the morphometric parameters of spring barley seedlings was studied. It has been shown that germination and seed germination energy, as well as the length of roots, aboveground parts, and dry biomass of plants depend in a complex way on the concentration of Cu in soils and substrates, as well as on their buffering capacity to heavy metals. Two mechanisms of Cu influence on plant development have been revealed, i.e., metabolic at C<sub>Cu</sub> 500 mg/kg of soil and diffusional at C<sub>Cu</sub> 500 mg/kg. Using the methods of regression analysis of experimental data, a multiple regression equation has been obtained that combines the morphometric index of plants, the concentration of Cu in substrates, and the buffering capacity of soils to Cu. On its basis, in the soil buffering capacity-Cu concentration coordinates, a curve of values of the maximum permissible concentrations of Cu in soils was built on a plane in the range from 17 to 2047 mg/kg. It permits us to separate the zone of permissible development of barley plants (a decrease of the morphometric index by 15%) from the zone of exceeding the accepted values of the maximum permissible concentration of Cu. Thus, the maximum permissible concentration is considered to be a function of Cu concentration, the soil buffering capacity to heavy metals, and plant species rather than a fixed value.
15	Effects of hazelnut husk waste on quality parameters of German primrose (Primula obconica Hance)	The study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using hazelnut shell waste as a growth medium for German primroses (Primula obconica Hance) under greenhouse conditions. Five different media combinations were prepared using sphagnum moss peat (SMP) and hazelnut husk waste (HHW). Some quality and growth parameters of P. obconica appeared to be significantly different depending on the growth medium. Results showed that HHW had a statistically significant impact on two parameters, namely aesthetic appearance score and mean flower weight, but had no impact on the other qualitative traits. The highest (8.94) and lowest (4.70) esthetic appearance scores were observed at 100% HHW and control treatments, respectively. In addition, the maximum (0.15 g) and minimum (0.097 g) mean flower weights were observed in HHW2 treatment and control plants, respectively.
16	Effect of soil mixtures based on a gneiss-derived soil and two forest floor types on growth and nutritional status of Castanea sativa Mill. seedlings	Aiming at the production of robust chestnut plants suitable for the establishment of plantations or for their use in afforestation of forest ecosystems, we studied the effect of soil mixtures on growth, physiological characteristics, and nutritional status of chestnut seedlings. In a complete randomized-block design pot experiment, the soil used was derived from gneiss weathering (GN) and the treatments included GN and GN with fertilization (GN-FER) as well as mixtures of GN with forest floor (FF) from chestnuts (GN-CFF) and from evergreen broad-leaved trees (GN-EFF). Both types of forest floor and fertilization had similar positive effect on seedlings growth and photosynthetic parameters. The most significant effects on soil nutrients were found in GN-CFF and GN-EFF treatments, except for extractable phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K), whose highest concentrations were observed in GN-FER. Leaf analysis showed that the concentrations of almost all nutrients in all treatments were within the adequacy limits, with the exception of nitrogen (N) in GN, copper (Cu) in GN-EFF, and K in all treatments. Both types of forest floor satisfied the nutritional needs of chestnut seedlings to a large extent and their incorporation in this type of soil combined with limited addition mainly of K and to a lesser degree of P could enhance adequacy of these nutrients in soil and plants. Thus, forest floor application may be an appropriate alternative to integrated nutrient management for robust chestnut seedlings production with significant forestry and environmental impacts.
17	Distribution and resorption efficiency of macroelements (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) in organs of Rumex alpinus L. in the Alps and the Giant (Krkonose) mountains	Rumex alpinus, an alpine nitrophilous species, is a troublesome weed in pastures. Nutrient uptake and distributions in the organs of Rumex alpinus are not well-studied. We aimed to determine the distribution of macroelements in organs of Rumex alpinus together with the nitrogen-phosphorus potassium ratio (NPK) and the resorption efficiency of N, P, K, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) in the Alps of Austria, Italy, and the Krkonose (Giant) Mountains, Czech Republic. The pseudo-total and plant-available N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in soils and organs of Rumex alpinus (emerging, mature, and senescent leaves, petioles, stems, and rhizomes) were extracted with aqua regia and Mehlich-3 procedures, respectively, followed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The contents of total and available macroelements in the soils reflected high variability with localities. There was a significant effect of locality and organs on the element contents, indicating differences in nutrition. Rumex alpinus exhibited higher N and P contents in emerging and mature leaves than in the senescent compared to Ca and Mg. The N:P and N:K ratios in the mature leaves were within the normal range but were indicative of comparatively higher demand for P. The mean resorption efficiency for N, P, and K was 52, 50, and 22%, respectively, lower than values for most terrestrial plants (62, 65, and 70%). The relatively high availability of macroelements in soils and plant organs with low N, P, and K resorption efficiency indicates a high N, P, and especially K-demanding species of Rumex alpinus.
18	Cattle dung and bioturbation by dung beetles improve oak seedling establishment in Mediterranean silvopastoral ecosystems	"This study aims to determine whether the application of cattle manure and associated bioturbation by dung beetles and other invertebrates can increase oak seedling establishment in the high biodiversity Mediterranean silvopastoral systems known as ""dehesas"", which are comprised of scattered oaks and a grassland layer and are used for livestock rearing. A two-year study was conducted in a representative dehesa in southern Spain. Firstly, the effect of cattle dung pads on acorn consumption by livestock and wild predators was monitored, along with dung beetle abundance and plot bioturbation. Secondly, the indirect effects of bioturbation on acorn burial, acorn predation by rodents and oak seedling establishment were assessed under the condition of livestock exclusion. The results consistently demonstrate a high positive indirect effect of the presence of cattle manure on the persistence of acorns, as well as on seedling establishment, as a result of reduced predation by rodents and improved microhabitat conditions for the acorns and seedlings. These processes were mediated by bioturbation. Tunneler dung beetles, which move a great amount of soil material, were dominant in our records, which suggest their importance for passive acorn burial, without disregarding the influence of other edaphic invertebrates present. We conclude that the presence of cattle manure significantly improves oak seedling establishment in Mediterranean dehesas through the passive burial of acorns by bioturbation, which acts to protect them from predation by rodents, desiccation and other damage. Passive acorn burial by dung beetles and other invertebrates thus emerges as an important ecosystem service that has been little-studied to date. Appropriate rotational management of livestock could therefore contribute to addressing the bottleneck of oak regeneration in Mediterranean dehesas."
19	Integrated application of selected elements of sustainability, circular economy, bioeconomy, and environmental management system in guesthouses	Efforts to minimize negative effects on the environment are manifested in the hospitality sector in the form of integrated application of elements of sustainable business, circular economy, bioeconomy, and environmental management. Those who run accommodation facilities are becoming environmentally aware and feel that they should be more involved in sustainable practices and thus contribute to improving the environment both locally and nationally. The main goal of this study is to identify and evaluate the application of selected elements and measures of sustainable business, circular economy, bioeconomy, and environmental management in guesthouses of the Czech Republic. A questionnaire survey (n1 = 343) was carried out together with a qualitative focus group method (n2 = 5); the data evaluation was carried out using advanced statistical methods (Tukey HSD test, Kruskal-Wallis test, correspondence analysis). The results showed that a higher classification in the guesthouse is associated with an increasing trend in the number of environmentally friendly operating methods used. Measures related to waste sorting containers (74%) and energy-saving and LED light bulbs (68%) showed the highest values. The results are useful for the practice of national professional associations that support the careful handling of resources and thereby influence the entire hospitality sector.
20	Synergistic effects of methyl jasmonate treatment and propagation method on Norway spruce resistance against a bark-feeding insect	Utilizing plants with enhanced resistance traits is gaining interest in plant protection. Two strategies are especially promising for increasing resistance against a forest insect pest, the pine weevil (Hylobius abietis): exogenous application of the plant defense hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and production of plants through the clonal propagation method somatic embryogenesis (SE). Here, we quantified and compared the separate and combined effects of SE and MeJA on Norway spruce resistance to pine weevil damage. Plants produced via SE (emblings) and nursery seedlings (containerized and bare-root), were treated (or not) with MeJA and exposed to pine weevils in the field (followed for 3 years) and in the lab (with a non-choice experiment). Firstly, we found that SE and MeJA independently decreased pine weevil damage to Norway spruce plants in the field by 32-33% and 53-59%, respectively, compared to untreated containerized and bare-root seedlings. Secondly, SE and MeJA together reduced damage to an even greater extent, with treated emblings receiving 86-87% less damage when compared to either untreated containerized or bare-root seedlings in the field, and by 48% in the lab. Moreover, MeJA-treated emblings experienced 98% lower mortality than untreated containerized seedlings, and this high level of survival was similar to that experienced by treated bare-root seedlings. These positive effects on survival remained for MeJA-treated emblings across the 3-year experimental period. We conclude that SE and MeJA have the potential to work synergistically to improve plants' ability to resist damage, and can thus confer a strong plant protection advantage. The mechanisms underlying these responses merit further examination.
21	First report of a 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris'-related strain (16Sri-B) associated with three Sempervivum cultivars in Hungary	In 2018, unusual symptoms were observed in Sempervivum plants in commercial nurseries in Hungary. Affected plants exhibited a section of the rosette emerging upwards above the foliage, with giant and often reddish leaves. These symptoms were observed in various Sempervivum species or varieties between 2019 and 2022, with approximately 1% of the plants showing these symptoms in specific cultivars. Leaves were collected from both symptomatic and symptomless plants of different taxa for DNA analysis. Nested PCR assays were performed, and amplicons were obtained from all diseased plants of Sempervivum cultivars Alpha, Purple Passion and Silberkarneol but not from asymptomatic plants of these cultivars. The DNA sequence analysis identified a 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris'-related strain in these symptomatic plants, which had 99.95% identity with Onion yellows phytoplasma and 'Muscari botryoides' aster yellows phytoplasma from the 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' (16SrI-B) subgroup. Monitoring over a year showed a recovery from the symptoms, and phytoplasmas were no longer detected by PCR after one year. This is thought to be the first identification of a 'Ca. P. asteris'-related strain in Sempervivum worldwide.
22	First report of Neofusicoccum parvum causing canker and dieback on Alnus glutinosa in Portugal	In March 2022, sunken cankers were observed on the stem and branches of young and mature Alnus glutinosa trees in central Portugal. Cankers were characterised by necrotic lesions on the outer and inner bark that progressively girdled the circumference of stem and branches causing extensive canopy dieback. The incidence of the disease was estimated at 70% (linear plot of 50 m long). Isolations from the diseased tissues resulted in 20 fungal colonies resembling Botryosphaeriaceae species based on colony appearance and hyaline, fusiform, aseptate, thin-walled conidia characteristics. These isolates were identified as Neofusicoccum parvum. The identification was further confirmed through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and comparison with the ex-type culture of N. parvum, exhibiting 100% sequence identity. Subsequent pathogenicity tests on common alder seedlings revealed similar necrotic lesions and wilting symptoms, fulfilling Koch's postulates. This is thought to be the first report of N. parvum affecting A. glutinosa in Portugal and in Europe.
23	First report of Querciphoma minuta causing branch and stem canker in Platanus x hispanica in Germany	In July and August 2022, numerous London plane (Platanus hispanica) trees in Cottbus, Germany, displayed large, dark-brown to red-brown lesions extending from the bark to the heartwood, affecting over 60% of the trees. Querciphoma minuta, a fungus within the Camarosporium complex, was identified in affected branches. Genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the identification. Pathogenicity tests revealed that Q. minuta caused necrosis and vascular discoloration in healthy plane tree seedlings, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Previously known to affect oak trees, this is thought to be the first report of Q. minuta as a potential canker pathogen of London plane trees. This suggests a broader host range and greater impact of the pathogen as a plant disease agent than previously recognized.
24	The quality of grape and wine of Merlot and Blatina varieties in the agroecological conditions of the Trebinje vineyard	The aim of this paper is to present the quality of grape and wine of Merlot and Blatina varieties in the agro ecological conditions of the Trebinje vineyard, during the vintages of 2016 and 2017. The vineyards were established in 2004 (Merlot) and in 2013 (Blatina), at an altitude of 269 m, with the planting distance of 2.8 x 1 m for Blatina and 2.8 x 0.9 m for Merlot. The Merlot and Blatina grape varieties were grafted on Berlandieri x Riparia Kober 5BB rootstock. The research included analysis of the sugar, total acid content and pH as parameters of grape quality. The following parameters of wine quality were analyzed: alcohol content, total acid, total ash, content of extract and total phenols. The quality of the grapes, grown in the conditions of Trebinje vineyard is suitable to produce quality red wines.
25	Stress induced by soil contamination with heavy metals and their effects on some biomarkers and DNA damage in maize plants at the vicinity of Ferronikel smelter in Drenas, Kosovo	The Ferronikel smelter in Drenas is one of the main industrial areas in the Kosovo and pollution by heavy metals causes serious threat for all living organisms on this area. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of some heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Cd, Ni and Pb) in agricultural soils and in maize plants, and their potential toxic effects on this plant through some sensitive biochemical and molecular markers. Maize seedlings growth in nine soil samples from different locations of this area. The highest concentrations of heavy metals in soils and maize leaves were conducted close to the Ferronikel smelter, and in some locations, the nickel and chromium concertation in soils exceeded 800 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. A significant effects of heavy metals induced toxicity resulted in the, build-up aminolevulinic acid and reduced activity of -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, and chlorophyll content in the maize leaves. In general, maize seedlings growth in polluted locations showed an increase in nuclear DNA content and in G2M phase. We concluded that locations close to the smelter are affected by soil heavy metals pollution and these biochemical and molecular analysis would be a powerful ecotoxicological tool in biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution.
26	Control of Phytonemus pallidus (Acari: Tarsonemidae) from strawberry transplants using controlled atmosphere temperature treatment	Since it inhabits young leaves and buds of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) crowns, cyclamen mite (Phytonemus pallidus Banks) is a difficult pest to control with biological or chemical means once it is present in a field. Controlled atmosphere temperature treatment (CATT) is a successful technique that has been commercially used in the Netherlands for nearly 2 decades to disinfect strawberry nursery stock, including elimination of cyclamen mite. During CATT, plants are treated at 35 degrees C, 50% CO2, and 10% O2 under high relative humidity for 48 h. The objective of this study was to test CATT against P. pallidus in North America at a scale that can be easily used on-farms by strawberry growers. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted where infested trayplants were treated with CATT or the acaricide abamectin, and P. pallidus number were compared to control plants. Plants were destructively sampled after 4 weeks, and CATT reduced mobile forms of P. pallidus by 99.9% in both experiments. Abamectin used in the first experiment had an efficacy of 95.5%. Our findings suggest that CATT is effective at nearly eliminating P. pallidus from strawberry planting material, and its application could reduce risks of field infestations and the need for multiple acaricide applications. While our results are encouraging, additional research is needed to assess the effects of CATT on strawberry plant survival, growth, and fruit production.
27	Bumblebees sense rootstock-mediated nutrition and fertilization regime in tomato. (Special Issue: Beneficial elements in plants: developing resilience under stressful environments.)	Aims: Since producing more with less is required for increasing agricultural sustainability and reducing its environmental impact, breeding varieties with increased yield stability under reduced fertilizer application is an important goal, particularly in high valued horticultural crops such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). However, because of the difficulties to conciliate yield and fertilizer use efficiency through breeding, the graft-compatible genetic biodiversity existing in horticultural species offers the possibility to directly approach this objective in high-yielding elite varieties through improving nutrient capture and promoting ecosystem services such as insect pollination. We hypothesized that rootstocks affect pollinator foraging decisions through the nutritional status that impacts yield.
28	Green compost amendment improves potato plant performance on Mars regolith simulant as substrate for cultivation in space. (Special Issue: Beneficial elements in plants: developing resilience under stressful environments.)	Background and aims: Higher plants represent an optimal tool to regenerate resources while producing food in Space. However, the configuration of fertile cultivation substrates based on extraterrestrial resources is still a challenge. We evaluated the adaptability of potato (Solanum tuberosum L., cv. 'Colomba') to the growth on six substrates: the MMS-1 Mars regolith simulant, alone (R100) and in mixture with 30% in vol. of green compost (R70C30), a fluvial sand, alone or mixed with 30% of compost (S100 and S70C30), a red soil from Sicily (RS), and a volcanic soil from Campania (VS).
29	Litter leachate as a potential selector of woody species germination at alpine treeline	The advancement of upper forest limits is driven by environmental conditions, but our current understanding overlooks the attributes of habitats and germination ability of woody species. Habitats, through plant litter, impact the competitive relation of germination and seedling growth. The aims of this study were to identify the selective effect of six litter leachates on the germination of indigenous Norway spruce (Picea abies) and nonindigenous dwarf pine (Pinus mugo) and compare the germination rates of the species. We collected plant litter and seeds from the (sub)alpine belt of the Hruby Jesenik Mts. (the Eastern Sudetes Mts.; the Czech Republic). We evaluated the effect of plant litter leachates from alpine heathlands, wind-swept alpine grasslands, subalpine tall-herb plants, Pinus mugo scrub, subalpine Vaccinium vegetation, and Norway spruce clonal groups on germination process under standard light and temperature conditions. The germination of Norway spruce was inhibited by the litter leachate from subalpine tall-herb vegetation mainly dominated by Calamagrostis villosa, whereas that of dwarf pine was not. The other five litter leachates had no significant effect on the both. Under standard conditions, the germination time of dwarf pine is on average one day faster. These results suggest that most of the litter leachates examined may have small impacts on the germinability and germination time of Norway spruce and dwarf pine, but litter from the subalpine tall-herb vegetation can act as a filter that influences the seedling composition of the woody species.
30	Perfect poopers; passerine birds facilitate sexual reproduction in clonal keystone plants of the boreal forest through directed endozoochory towards dead wood	Berry-producing Vaccinium shrubs are keystone species in boreal forest ecosystems and their berries provide an essential food source for many vertebrates. In Fennoscandia, both the abundance and cover of Vaccinium have decreased in forests, with intensive forestry practice as a main driver. Vaccinium seedling recruitment is constricted to recruitment windows of opportunity and appears to be infrequent, mainly due to seed dispersal limitation. Passerine birds are key players in seed dispersal, which can be directed towards perching points such as coarse woody debris.In this study, we investigated the potential for directed endozoochory by passerine birds towards cut stumps and if such stumps were viable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, in an intensively managed boreal forest landscape of central Norway. We surveyed stump and paired forest floor microsites for passerine scat (i.e. potential seed rain) and Vaccinium seedlings. We collected passerine scat and conducted germination experiments to assess if they contained viable seed. We tested the microsite effect (i.e. forest floor/stump) on scat deposition and seedling establishment and then used modified ensemble classifiers to identify important environmental factors affecting scat deposition and seedling establishment patterns.We found that passerine scat was disproportionally deposited on stumps, and that the vast majority of scat contained viable Vaccinium seed. Stumps were also suitable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, as a higher probability of seedling establishment occurred at stumps compared with the forest floor. However, scat deposition and seedling establishment at stumps were rather contextual and determined by environmental variables. The probability of scat deposition increased with higher complexity of the vertical forest structure and lower canopy cover, whereas seedling establishment required bryophyte cover and larger stumps, or alternatively smaller stumps with competition-free spaces. Our results highlight a pathway to successful sexual reproduction for Vaccinium species in managed forests: passerine birds direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards tree stumps, which can offer suitable conditions for seedling establishment. However, the spatiotemporal variability both in forest stand structure and in stump conditions have a strong influence on the success of sexual recruitment via this pathway.
31	Insect pests in hemp	Industrial hemp plants have many unique physical, physiological and biochemical characteristics. These combine to make it among the best converters of solar energy, carbon dioxide, water and silica to plant biomass among commercialised plant species. One of the facets of this success is the ability to resist attack by potential animal pests. Most parts of the plant are resistant to physical attack by virtue of their strength and hardness and their chemical composition. The stems' fibre sheath is uniquely strong, but this physical characteristic is only half of the story in its ability to resist attack from pests. The other half lies in the multiplicity of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, terpenoids and sterols that are similar to compounds that provide resistance to the feeding activities of arthropods and mammals in other plant species. Sadly, there is little scientific proof of this statement: It is a presumption supported by what we see in 'farmers' fields, in Australia and around the world. This does not mean industrial hemp has no insect pests but there seems to be no specific cadre of insects attached to this crop - anywhere. Note that hemp is still a 'new' crop' outside Europe and hemp fields are well dispersed across rural landscapes. All around the world we find small groups of insects that are 'general' pests of many farming systems crops. They seem to have the ability to nullify the natural resistance factors of many plant hosts. The Australian group focuses mainly on the seed heads (and sometimes the seedlings). cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and native budworm (H. punctigera) are the most damaging. They find and colonise dispersed crops without difficulty. It is rare to visit a grain crop during the reproductive phase without finding Helicoverpa caterpillars as well as Rutherglen bug (Nysius vinitor) and green vegetable bug (Nezara viridula), which are similarly pandemic, but probably less damaging. Then there is a further group of species that is diverse, sporadic, potentially devastating and even more difficult to define in economic terms: leaf beetles (Monoleptis australis), mirids (Creontiades pallida), stem borer (cerambycid beetle), seed-collecting ants, wireworms and red-legged earth mite (Halotydeus destructor). Then there is another group of insects found on hemp plants that are 'probably just visiting' from weeds etc. They include cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) and miscellaneous grass moths. Effective management interventions include organic, biological, and conventional options.
32	Morphological definition populations of Allium ursinum L. from the western part of the republic of Serbia	In Western Serbia, at an altitude of 80 to 1211 m, thirteen populations of wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.) were discovered at different localities in eight different soil types. Plant material was sampled from each of the thirteen localities by the method of random sampling. Morphological parameters were measured on the sampled plant material: length of aboveground and underground part of the plant, bulb thickness, weight, length, leaf width, length and thickness of the flower stalk, with the aim of assessing the locality that has the most productive morphological parameters. The populations of Allium ursinum growing on the mountains Povlen and Rudnik have the most productive morphological parameters. It can be said that wild garlic in these two localities is the most adequate plant material for harvesting fresh plant material, which will be used for other research in agronomy.
33	Nitrogen rates influence on radicchio yield and yield components	"Field experiments were laid out in two consecutive seasons between 2019 and 2020 on the laboratory field of Biotechnical centre in Naklo near Kranj, Slovenia (an altitude: 420 m; = 46 degrees 16' 18""; a = 14 degrees 18' 56""). It was conducted with the objective of finding the effect of nitrogen application levels (0 - control, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg/ha) and 6 cultivars ('Monivip', 'Castel Franco', 'Anivip', 'Foresto', 'Palla rossa' and 'Verona') on yield and yield components of headed chicory. Trial was arranged in spilt plot factorial scheme (main plot - N levels; subplots - cultivars) on randomized complete block design base with four replications for all the seasons. The N fertilizers were applied as KAN (27% calcium amonium nitrate) in two split doses (at transplanting and 40 days after transplanting). The experimental variables measured were fresh weight (g/plant) and yield attributes (dry matter, crop height, leaf number and head firmness). There was no interaction effect of cultivar and nitrogen application levels of tested parameters. Highest fresh weight (360.2 g/crop) achived when the cultivars received 150 kg N/ha. In contrast, percentage of dry matter content and firmmness of radicchio heads decreased as increased soil N supply. Crops that received 150 kg N/ha recived heighst height (34.5 cm). N levels were not significantly effect on the leaf number of the mature heads."
34	Hypoglycin A in Acer genus plants	Hypoglycin A (HGA) is an amino acid occuring in the Sapindaceae family. Ingestion of certain Acer genus plants belonging to this family has been connected with atypical myopathy (AM) or seasonal pasture myopathy (SPM). To date, all cases of AM/SPM have been associated with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and boxelder maple (Acer negundo). The aim of this work was to determine and compare HGA in sycamore, boxelder and silver maple (Acer saccharinum), the trees known for HGA content, whose occurence is quite common in the Czech Republic. In sycamore and boxelder maple the effect of location, weather condition and sampling season was evaluated. The other aim was screening for presence of HGA in 12 other species of Acer genus which are grown as ornamental trees in Europe. The determination of HGA was conducted using ultra - high performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS). HGA was detected in all samples of sycamore, boxelder and silver maple except for eight leave samples of boxelder maple. In the case of sycamore maple, the highest concentrations of HGA (median) were found in seedlings (770 mg/kg) followed by samaras (130 mg/kg) and by leaves (48 mg/kg) and inflorescences (24 mg/kg). In boxelder maple, significantly higher concentrations of HGA (median) were found in seedlings (550 mg/kg) compared with samaras (45 mg/kg), leaves (14 mg/kg) and inflorescences (24 mg/kg). According to the results the seedlings could pose a significant risk of poisoning, although other factors such as accessibility and palatability of other parts, especially samaras, should be considered. No significant differences of HGA concentrations in silver maple (56 mg/kg) were found between samaras, leaves and inflorescences. HGA was also identified in sugar maple (Acer saccharum), Japanese maple (Acer palmatum), trident maple (Acer buergerianum), paperbark maple (Acer griseum) and Himalayan maple (Acer oblongum). Although silver maple and other ornamental maples have not been reported to cause AM/SPM, the possibility of intoxication in animals can not be excluded.
35	Breeding assessment of leafiness for species, varieties and ecotypes of genus Festuca	Species of the genus Festuca are valuable forage plants in natural and sown grasslands, used for hay, grazing, anti-erosion and ornamental purposes. The proportion of leaves in the biomass is an important breeding criterion, with a direct influence on the forage quality. The aim is to evaluate the leafiness of species, varieties and ecotypes of fescue and and make a selection in view of the breeding. The object of the study are accessions of local and foreign origin from genus Festuca. In the autumn of 2015 in the experimental field of the Institute of Forage Crops - Pleven was established collection nursery (KP), with individual plants, including 3 species: tall, meadow and red fescue, including 4 varieties, 3 ecotypes and 1 breeding population, or a total of 8 accessions of fescue, by origin - 5 Bulgarian (BG) and 3 Romanian (RO); by level of ploidy - 6 hexaploid (6n), 1 tetraploid (4n) and 1 diploid (2n). During the period 2016 - 2019, annually at the first forage cut samples were taken for leafiness. The reporting is, based on dry mass, as a share of leaves of total biomass, %. Mean, minimum, maximum values, standard deviations and coefficients of variation by years and average for the period are calculated. The variation of the trait, expressed by CV, averaged a strong 21.72% over the period, with differences by year - strongest in 2016, CV=30.76%, and relatively weakest in 2019. CV=13.93% middle grade. Average values for leafiness vary among specimens, years and genetic constitution (ecotype, variety). The accessions are distributed according to the degree of leafiness, as follows: low foliage: up to 25% - there are no accessions; medium leafy: from 26% to 50% - 2 accession red fescue variety Capriora and local ecotype Atoluka, and strong leafy: over 50% - 6 accessions, in ascending order - red fescue local ecotype Ravnogor, meadow fescue Transilvan and Merifest T, tall fescue IRGR Sadovo, Adela and Albena. On average for the period, tall fescue variety Albena is the leafiest 59.54%.
36	Insight into a complex of phenolic compounds in plump fruits (Prunus domestica L.) in the conditions of Tambov oblast	The fruits of Prunus domestica L. are a valuable source of phenolic compounds, in particular hydroxycinnamic acids and their esters. Hybrid origin of Prunus domestica hexaploid species, the ample number of the varieties, and expanded geograph y of the cultivation preclude scientists from arriving at a definitive conclusion on the content levels and composition of phenolic compounds in plum fruits. The goal of our study is to determine and identify the phenolic composition of fruits of Prunus domestica L. grown in Tambov oblast of the Russian Federation. The research focused on eight fresh-eating and all-purpose varieties. Experimental plantations were established in 2014 in the 6 x 3-m setup. The plum-cherry hybrid (SVG) 11-19 was used as a rootstock. The phenolic components of plum fruits were determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) using a Thermo Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system equipped with a DAD-3000 detector. A chromatography run of the plum fruit methanol extracts was performed through a mobile phase binary gradient represented by acetonitrile and aqueous potassium dihydrogen phosphate acidified with orthophosphoric acid to pH 2.5. The hydroxycinnamic acids in the plum fruits were determined to be as follows: 5.33-181.54 mg/100 g of 4-Caffeoylquinic acid, 1.69-31.73 mg/100 g of 5-Caffeoylquinic acid, 0.54-5.77 mg/100 g of 3-p-Coumaroylquinic acid, and 0.04-0.63 mg/100 g of 3-Caffeoylquinic acid. Quercitin-3-rutinoside at 0.77-9.17 mg/100 g was dominant among flavonols. Three anthocyanins, namely, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and peonidin-3-glucoside, were identified in the studied plum fruits. The structural composition of plum fruit anthocyanins was dominated by cyaniding-3-glucoside, accounting for 60 to 90% of the total anthocyanin content. The obtained data on the content of phenolic components in fruits of specified plum varieties (Prunus domestica L.) point toward the potential of the use of the specified plum varieties as a source of hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols in the population diet.
37	Metabolomics and DNA-based authentication of two traditional Asian medicinal and aromatic species of Salvia subg. Perovskia	Subgenus Perovskia of the extended genus of Salvia comprises several Central Asian medicinal and aromatic species, of which S. yangii and S. abrotanoides are the most widespread. These plants are cultivated in Europe as robust ornamentals, and several cultivars are available. However, their medicinal potential remains underutilized because of limited information about their phytochemical and genetic diversity. Thus, we combined an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) based metabolomics with DNA barcoding approach based on trnH-psbA and ITS2 barcodes to clarify the relationships between these two taxa. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that aerial parts are more similar than roots and none of the major compounds stand out as distinct. Sugiol in S. yangii leaves and carnosic acid quinone in S. abrotanoides were mostly responsible for their chemical differentiation, whereas in roots the distinction was supported by the presence of five norditerpenoids in S. yangii and two flavonoids and one norditerpenoid in S. abrotanoides. To verify the metabolomics-based differentiation, we performed DNA authentication that revealed S. yangii and S. abrotanoides to be very closely related but separate species. We demonstrated that DNA barcoding coupled with parallel LC-MS profiling constitutes a powerful tool in identification of taxonomically close Salvia species.
38	Effect of rootstock selection on tree growth, yield, and fruit quality of lemon varieties cultivated in Greece	Lemon is a prominent citrus fruit that supports regional economies worldwide. Several agronomic and fruit quality attributes are affected by the rootstock selection, thus its selection is essential for a successful grove. This study aims to compare the agronomic and quality attributes of four lemon cultivars ('Mikrokarpo Messaras', 'Nouvel Athos', 'Femminello Commune,' and 'Zia gara Bianca') grafted onto three rootstocks ('Sour Orange', 'Yuma Ponderosa lemon', and 'Volkameriana'). The yield and rootstock/scion ratio were estimated along with fruit morphological characteristics (size, equatorial, and polar diameter). Internal fruit quality was also estimated (total soluble solids, total acidity, juiciness, ascorbic acid, total phenols, and total antioxidant activity). 'Volkameriana' rootstock stood out among the studied rootstocks, as all grafted lemon varieties increased their productivity. Its combination with the Italian cultivar 'Femminello Commune' exhibited enhanced tree vigor and tree yield. For all studied cultivars, the use of 'Volkameriana' or 'Yuma Ponderosa lemon' rootstocks decreased the total soluble content and total acidity, increased the ascorbic acid content, and did not influence the TSS/TA ratio, total phenols or total antioxidant activity. In conclusion, the vigorous 'Volkameriana' and 'Yuma Ponderosa lemon' rootstocks are a promising replacement for 'sour orange'. This research provides valuable insights into the potential use of 'Yuma Ponderosa lemon' as a rootstock for lemons, as existing literature is rather limited.
39	The state of apple	The RHS fruit naming service addresses the global fascination with apples beyond horticulture, catering to a rising demand for identification. Receiving 1000 to 1200 cultivars annually, the RHS covers the entire UK, aiming for comprehensive coverage, notably in the South East, South West, and North of England. Samples, sourced from diverse locations, inform planting trends and historical insights. Identification involves a mix of experience, books, online tools, and comparisons. DNA testing is a last resort. The top 10 cultivars in 2022, including Bramley's Seedling, reveal popular varieties and their characteristics. The service adapts to modern interests, receiving cultivars like Falstaff, reflecting a continual quest to preserve apple diversity.
40	Seed weight and optimal imbibition period for some herbaceous peony (Paeonia spp.) species native to Serbia	Herbaceous peonies are plant species with high ornamental and medicinal value. Due to their endangerment, wild peonies are protected by law in Serbia. Possible ways to protect them are propagation and/or cultivation. Peonies can be propagated vegetatively (by rhizome division) or generatively (with seeds). As peony seeds have a double dormancy and their germination is a long-term process, it is important to determine which seed characteristics and pre-treatments have a positive effect on germination. Since peony seed weight is an important seed characteristic, and imbibition period is an effective pre-treatment, the aim of this study was to evaluate the peony species native to Serbia, and to determine seed mass, seed imbibition capacity, the influence of seed weight on imbibition and the influence of habitat on the studied parameters, as the mentioned parameters have hardly been studied for the tested species. The research was conducted in 2021. on three peony species native to Serbia (Paeonia tenuifolia L.-fern leaf peony or steppe peony; Paeonia peregrina Mill.-Balkan peony or Kosovo peony and Paeonia daurica Andrews). According to our one-year research, there was no statistically significant difference in seed weight depending on the natural habitat within the species and also not between P. peregrina and P. daurica. A significant difference was found in seed weight between steppe peonies and the other two studied species. In agreement with our results, the optimal imbibition time is two to three days for P. peregrina and one to two days for P. tenuifolia and P. daurica. The findings can be used as preliminary research for future peony germination studies.
41	Effects of cultivar and plant origin on the aeroponic production of potato minitubers	Aeroponics is eco-friendly, soilless technology for the cultivation of vegetable plants that can be used for the production of pathogen-free pre-basic seed potato, namely minitubers. In aeroponic modules, the underground parts of potato plants grow suspended in the mist of finely dispersed nutrient solution to produce tubers, while the shoots grow above the module under greenhouse conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the cultivar and origin of planting material on the minituber production in an aeroponic facility in Guca, Serbia. Two potato cultivars, Sinora and Agria, and two types of planting material, acclimated microplants and plants originating from sprouted minitubers, were used in the study. Plants were grown in the 2019 season with a planting density of 24 plants per m2 and ~14-day harvest intervals. Agria plants of both plant origins steadily tuberized during most of the cultivation period and formed a significantly larger number of minitubers (13.61) compared to cultivar Sinora (3.35), which quickly completed the growth cycle. In both investigated cultivars, the mass of formed minitubers was significantly higher in the plants originating from minitubers (18.80 g) compared to plants of in vitro origin (9.04 g). Agria plants of minituber origin produced the heaviest minitubers (19.05 g), while Sinora plants of in vitro origin formed the least heavy tubers (5.29 g). The highest yield of minitubers, 6.26 kg m-2, was recorded for Agria plants of minituber origin. The results of our study suggest that both plant origin and potato genotype significantly affect minituber production in aeroponics.
42	Experimental investigation of the responses of meadow buttercup (Ranunculus acris L.) to sodic salinity and its implications for habitat monitoring	Ranunculus acris L. is a native species widely distributed throughout Europe and is invasive in nonnative areas, causing substantial economic losses in pasture productivity. The present study examined the effects of sodic salinity on the growth and functioning of this species. Salinity stresses the germination process and seedling growth, indicating that the studied species experience serious limitations at 60-90 mmol dm<sup>-3</sup> NaCl and cannot establish in habitats where salinity is equal to or greater than 150 mmol dm<sup>-3</sup> NaCl. R. acris is tuned to subsaline habitats characteristic of temperate meadows, as its growth and functioning were the best when the plants were treated with 30 mmol dm<sup>-3</sup> NaCl. Increasing salinity (60 and 90 mmol dm<sup>-3</sup> NaCl) hampered growth, leaf morphology and photosynthesis but not mineral nutrition, as Na accumulation seemed to be the most outlined effect of NaCl application. Changes in leaf morphological characteristics coordinated well with Na content in those organs, which indicates that leaf appearance can be easily catchable sign of progressing salinity. Ultimately, progressing salinity reduces the competitiveness of the studied species, shifting its strategy to ruderal behavior, but under subsaline conditions, the strategy of this species seems to be most balanced.
43	Sexual reproduction in two mixed stands of coastal and interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in Germany	Adult individuals and seeds of two mixed stands of coastal and interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were analysed for genetic differentiation between the two varieties and evidence of intervarietal pollination. Clear genetic discrimination between the two varieties was observed based on multilocus evaluation of nine microsatellite markers using other Douglas-fir stands of known variety composition for comparison. Analysis of pollination distances showed that 80% of pollinations took place within a distance of about 44-55 m. Analysis of stand structure showed clearly separated areas of mainly coastal or interior Douglas-fir within both stands. Together with short pollination distances this led to an apparent dominance of intravarietal pollinations. However, analysis of pollination partners of trees growing near the border of the variety specific areas, does not indicate the existence of reproductive barriers between trees of the two varieties growing in mixed stands. Therefore, commercial seed harvesting in mixed stands should be avoided if the production of seed lots of pure coastal or interior Douglas-fir is intended.
44	Infestation of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings with the pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus Steiner and Buhrer (Nickle) through wood sawdust	Key message: There are various pathways for infesting pine trees with the pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. As a result of the experiment, we determined that sawdust infested with the nematode can pose a phytosanitary risk. Nematodes actively moved from infested sawdust into root or stem damaged pine seedlings. Context: The spread of PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in pine plantations and forests is caused by beetles of the genus Monochamus, but the nematode can also be introduced via different coniferous commodities. Aims: The study objective was to assess the possibility that injured roots and stems of Pinus sylvestris seedlings could be infested with PWN through nematode-infested sawdust.
45	Seed treatment potential for the improvement of lucerne seed performance and early field growth	Seed treatments have a potential to improve seed performance traits and consequently optimize crop establishment. However, there is a lack of systematic research for these techniques in lucerne, especially under field conditions. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of various seed treatments on the improvement of lucerne germination and emergence under lab conditions and early seedling growth in the field. Compared treatments were heat treatment; seed priming with water, potassium permanganate, chitosan, vermitea, or bokashi juice; and seed coating with cinnamon, gypsum, wood ash, tannin quebracho, and cocoa powder. Among the seed priming methods, potassium permanganate and chitosan provided the best results in the improvement of seedling length or emergence dynamics, whilst coating with bentonite and gypsum could be recommended for having a positive impact on root development. Cinnamon powder significantly improved the emergence dynamics, seedling, and shoot length. The combination of priming and coating methods seems to be the most effective when assessed under the field conditions, where some positive response in root traits can be evaluated.
46	Effect of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seedling age and cultivation method on seedling quality, photosynthetic parameters and productivity	The age of seedlings affects not only the quality of the seedlings but also the yield. The age of seedlings of sweet peppers grown in a greenhouse and their cultivation method has been little studied. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the effect of agrotechnological tools (direct seeding or transplanting) on sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seedling quality and crop yield. The research was carried out in a greenhouse covered with double polymeric film at the Institute of Horticulture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. Two factors were investigated: seedling establishment method (direct seeding and transplanting) and their different age (60, 50, and 40 days). The 60-day-old seedlings (both sown directly and grown by transplanting) were taller, and had more leaves, a larger leaf area, and a thicker stem, than the 50- and 40-day-old seedlings. The highest content of dry matter was found in the leaves of 60-day-old seedlings that were grown by transplanting. The chlorophyll index was also highest in the leaves of these seedlings. The highest photosynthetic parameters (photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO<sub>2</sub>, transpiration rate) were found in the leaves of 40-day-old seedlings (both sown directly and grown by transplanting). Higher yields were demonstrated in sweet peppers whose seedlings were planted in the greenhouse at the age of 60 days and which were sown directly in cups.
47	The content of Cd and Pb in herbs and single-component spices used in Polish cuisine	Spices and herbs play an important role in the human diet, mostly due to the presence of essential oils and high antioxidant activity. Therefore, the toxicity of metals raises concerns about the safety of consumption of spices and herbs. This paper examines the content of Cd and Pb in fresh and dried herbs and single-component spices that are the most popular in Polish cuisine: 100 samples of nine kinds of dried herbs, 184 samples of 15 kinds of fresh herbs and 148 samples of 14 kinds of loose single-component spices. The level of Cd and Pb was determined using the GF AAS method. The safety of herbs and spices for consumption was estimated based on the percentage intake of Cd and Pb compared with the tolerable intake (% TWI, % BMDL), chronic daily intake (CDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and comparisons of the results of chemical analyses with the maximum admissible levels of Cd and Pb in Poland and in the European Union. Calculated per fresh weight of the product, dried herbs on average contained 0.134 +or- 0.168 mg of Cd and 0.548 +or- 0.161 mg of Pb per kg<sup>-1</sup>, fresh herbs on average contained 0.004 +or- 0.007 mg of Cd and 0.039 +or- 0.033 mg of Pb per kg<sup>-1</sup>, and the mean content of Cd in spices was 0.017 +or- 0.019 mg per kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.064 +or- 0.050 mg of Pb. The % TWI, % BMDL, CDI, THQ and HI (Cd + Pb) for all the analysed products were lower than 1. The results do not imply a risk due to the supply of Cd and Pb with the diet to the human body, primarily due to the small intake of these products. However, it should be highlighted that the content of Cd in dried coriander and estragon and that of Pb in watercress, jiaogulan, celery, basil and dill exceeded the acceptable limit. Thus, their consumption for people from particularly sensitive groups such as babies, pregnant and breastfeeding women and people should be carefully limited.
48	Phenotyping grapevine cultivars for resistance to Eutypa dieback. (Special issue on grapevine trunk diseases.)	Eutypa dieback of grapevine is a trunk disease that affects vineyard productivity. Wood symptoms of this disease develop consistently in greenhouse-grown plants, after inoculation of woody stems with the causal fungus Eutypa lata. Wood symptoms are a common measure of host cultivar resistance and E. lata isolate virulence. Leaf symptoms of the disease also develop in the greenhouse, although reports of low correlations between severity of wood and leaf symptoms (for some cultivars and isolates) indicate that a definitive procedure is required for evaluating cultivar resistance. Three 'phenotyping assays', replicated with two E. lata isolates (BX1-10 and M14), were assessed for quantifying resistance of a set of Vitis vinifera cultivars ('Black Corinth', 'Carignane', 'Husseine', 'Merlot', 'Muscat Hamburg', 'Palomino', 'Peloursin', 'Primitivo', and 'Thompson Seedless'). The methods were: Assay 1 (leaf and woody-stem symptoms measured 1 year post-inoculation on plants propagated from rooted, dormant cuttings); Assay 2 (green stem symptoms measured 4 months post-inoculation on plants propagated from rooted, green cuttings); and Assay 3 (leaf symptoms measured 6 weeks post-inoculation on plants propagated from rooted, dormant cuttings). High rates of mortality among some cultivars ('Merlot') in Assay 3 confounded results based on leaf symptoms. Results from Assays 1 and 2 were more consistent with each other, especially for the most resistant cultivars ['Merlot' and 'Primitivo' (aka 'Zinfandel')]', than they were for these cultivars in Assay 3. Compared to resistant cultivars, there was more variation in the most susceptible cultivar, including 'Black Corinth', 'Carignane', 'Husseine', and 'Thompson Seedless', regardless of the assay. Assay 1 with isolate BX1-10 was the most repeatable and provided data on wood and leaf symptoms for cultivar comparisons. Assay 2 was the most rapid, and gave results similar to those from Assay 1. Assay 2 also accommodated germplasm that can only be propagated from green cuttings.
49	Impact of quince clonal rootstocks on yield and fruit quality characteristics of European pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivars	The study was conducted during two sequential research years of 2020 and 2021 at the fruit research station of Ondokuz Mayis University, Turkiye. The aim of the research was to assess the effect of quince clonal rootstocks (Province Quince BA29 [BA29], Quince A [QA], and Quince MC [MC]) on yield and fruit quality of pear cultivars ('Deveci', 'Williams', 'Santa Maria' and 'Abate Fetel'). Fruit weight, width, length, fruit stalk length and thickness, fruit color traits (L*, a*, b*, chroma, hue degrees ), fruit firmness, total soluble solids, acidity, pH, marketable fruit rate, black spotted fruit rate, and preharvest fruit drop rate were evaluated as quality properties. In the case of yield attributes, number of fruit per tree, yield per tree, yield per hectare, yield per trunk cross sectional area, and yield per canopy volume were taken into consideration. Results of the research revealed that all aforementioned evaluated characteristics were statistically significantly affected under three factors combination at the 5 level of significance (P < 0.05) when Duncan's multiple range test was applied to the data. In brief, it was revealed that treatment combinations affected yield and quality characteristics. In general, in terms of yield per tree and yield per hectare, it was observed that the 'Santa Maria' cultivar gave better results in all rootstocks.
50	Physiological and biochemical parameters of drought tolerance of some genotypes of garden roses	To identify drought resistance of the studied genotypes of garden roses during the period of maximum probability of drought on the Southern Coast of the Crimea, the water regime, proline concentration, enzyme activity and chlorophyll fluorescence induction parameters under controlled dehydration were studied. Analysis of water regime parameters showed that under conditions of water stress, the best water-holding and recovery capabilities were shown by leaves of cv. 'Borisfen' and R. hugonis species. Species R. indica, R. bracteata, R. rouletti, R. foetida showed instability of water regime under conditions imitating dry weather. Studies of changes in biochemical parameters revealed that under relatively mild wilting conditions after removal of stress, metabolic processes are restored in R. hugonis, R. bracteata, R. indica and cv. 'Borisfen'. Wilting under conditions imitating dry weather does not cause irreversible metabolic disturbances in R. hugonis, R. bracteata, and cv. 'Borisfen'. Under different wilting conditions, cv. 'Borisfen'and R. foetida species had relatively stable functioning of FS II. Simulation of dry weather led to irreversible disturbances in the oxygen-releasing complex and thylakoid destruction in R. gallica during the stressor, and in R. indica and R. bracteata species - after recovery of water availability. The highest drought tolerance is in in cv. 'Borisfen' and R. hugonis sprcies.
51	Biodegradable mulching film vs. traditional polyethylene: effects on yield and quality of San Marzano tomato fruits	Mulching is a common practice for improving crop yield and obtaining an out-of-season production, but when made using plastic materials it can bring environmental problems due to the management and the disposal of films at the end of the cropping seasons. To increase the sustainability of this practice, recently, mulching films made with biodegradable organic materials have become more widely used. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of a biodegradable mulching film on yield and qualitative traits of the San Marzano tomato fruits over two years (2014 and 2015). Two different types of mulching were tested: (i) black biodegradable film (MB12) and (ii) black low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were compared to bare soil (BS). Both mulching films elicited a 25% increase in yield, mainly due to the significantly higher number of fruits per square meter, compared to BS. Both mulching films also elicited a 9.9% increase in total soluble solids and a 57% increase in carotenoid content, while firmness showed the highest value in BS fruits. MB12 determined the highest value of the Hunter color ratio a/b of tomato fruits, followed by LDPE, while the lowest value was recorded in BS fruits. Both mulching films elicited an increase of 9.6%, 26.0%, and 11.7% for flavonoids, polyphenols, and AsA, respectively. In 2014, the MB12 degradation started at 71 days after transplant (DAT); in 2015, at 104 DAT. Therefore, replacing polyethylene with biodegradable film would seem to be an agronomically efficient and environmentally sustainable practice.
52	Patterns of copper bioaccumulation and translocation in grapevine grafts depending on rootstocks	The long-term use of copper (Cu) fungicides in viticulture in Europe has led to Cu accumulation in vineyard top soils. However, less is known about the accumulation of Cu in grapevine grafts after the callusing process/before planting in the nursery. This paper presents the capacity of 5BB and SO4 rootstocks to accumulate Cu, as well as the patterns of translocation in the grafts. After heat forcing (callusing), the grapevine grafts of Sauvignon Blanc on 5BB and SO4 rootstocks were grown in pots for six months in a glasshouse and exposed to various Cu formulations (Cu-oxychloride, Cu-gluconate) and concentrations in peat (50, 150, 500, and 1000 mg Cu of dry weight (DW)). In addition to monitoring the shoot growth dynamics and analyzing the copper content in graft organs, bioaccumulation (BAFs) and translocation factors (TFs) of Cu were calculated. The mean Cu concentrations were ranked as follows: roots (15-164) > rootstock trunks (8-38) > canes (5-21) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> DW. The Cu concentrations depended on the Cu formulation and concentration in the substrate. Higher Cu content was found in the roots of both rootstocks (5BB and SO4, 23-155 and 15-164 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> DW, respectively) and the lowest in the canes (less than 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> DW) of grafts grown in Cu-oxychloride-treated peat. Based on the BAFs and TFs, both rootstocks could be considered as Cu exclusive. A higher translocation rate was determined in systemic Cu-gluconate and SO4 rootstock. With shoot length measurements, the significant inhibitory effects of Cu on grapevine grafts growth could not be confirmed, despite the inhibitory effects that were clearly expressed in the first two months of growth. Soils containing more than 500 mg Cu/kg<sup>-1</sup> are less suitable for growing vine grafts.
53	Analysis regarding the organization, establishment, maintenance and harvesting of sea bunckthorn in plantation	Romania brings its contribution to the European Union through a valuable heritage, with numerous species of plants and animals, some endemic and relict, among them medicinal plants and those with high nutritional value. Romania's geographical position and climate have always offered special conditions for favourable for the culture of fruit trees and shrubs. Around towns, in familiar gardens, in small spaces around buildings, on walls and trellises, the cultivation of various species of trees and shrubs is a leisure occupation and a source of fruit supply. Fruit trees and shrubs in parks, around houses, on roads and alignments, in addition to aesthetics and fruit production, contribute to improving the climate, preventing and combating environmental pollution. Hippophae rhamnoides-Sea buckthorn is a shrub of particular importance, found both in spontaneous flora and in controlled cultures. In Romania, sea buckthorn grows spontaneously in the Subcarpathian area of Moldova and Muntenia. Depending on the place where it is planted, sea buckthorn can grow as a shrub or tree at a height of 1.5 m to 3.5 m, or even more. In arid areas it can become creeping, being an adaptation to environmental conditions. Sea buckthorn is used in food, medicine, animal feed and forestry. Used in agriculture, buckthorn has a very important role in increasing the winter resistance of bees. From a nutritional point of view, sea buckthorn has a high content of minerals, vitamins, oils, acids and unsaturated fats, present in the fruits and leaves. Sea buckthorn fruits have a high content of vitamin E, C and carotenoids with strong oxidative action, which slow down aging. Sea buckthorn oil relieves light medication, heals wounds and skin lesions, burns and speeds up the healing process Considering the special valences in maintaining health and treating some ailments, we must take care of this natural wealth of Romania - buckhorn, and we must not consider it inexhaustible, in order not to disappear especially from the spontaneous flora before our eyes.
54	Reciprocal bark exchange helps to disentangle tree species-dependent bark and wood trait effects on invertebrate diversity	Previous studies showed that bark cover at early-decay stage had profound control on the invertebrate assemblages of bark and wood, with possible consequence for the decomposition process. However, previous experimental designs could not disentangle how bark versus wood traits affect the invertebrate assemblage process in bark and/or wood separately because wood traits of different tree species may vary independently from bark traits. Furthermore, we do not know whether such tree species-specific bark trait effects are still influential at mid-decay stage. To unravel whether and how bark and wood traits influence invertebrate communities in tree logs at mid-decay stage, we introduce reciprocal bark transplantation within pairs of different tree species as a new method. We applied this method to two pairs of phylogenetically contrasting species of gymnosperms (pair I: Araucaria araucana and Cryptomeria japonica, pair II: Picea abies and Thuja plicata) and another gymnosperm (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) set as disturbance control to test for potential bark manipulation artefacts on invertebrate community composition. Our bark exchange experiment revealed that both bark and wood host abundant and divergent subsets of invertebrates on mid-decay logs of different tree species. We further documented that the invertebrate community composition was predominantly shaped by the traits of host tissue per se, while also being significantly but less strongly affected by the traits of the other tissue, that is, the adjacent bark or wood. Our results indicated that bark trait effects faded with time and how long bark trait effects persist greatly depends on bark thickness. Synthesis. Our study suggests that maintaining deadwood heterogeneity related to variation between tree species and bark versus wood, is important for nursing a large biodiversity of invertebrates. Combined with bark removal methodology, our bark exchange method can be further extended to more decay stages and more forest biomes to track bark trait effects and bark induced priority effects on deadwood decomposition, and its associated invertebrate and microbial communities.
55	Basic chemical composition, antioxidant activity and selected polyphenolic compounds profile in garlic leaves and bulbs collected at various stages of development	Garlic is commonly used as vegetable or spice and as a herb in folklore as well as traditional medicine in many countries. The current study aimed to compare the chemical composition, antioxidant activity, and the content of selected polyphenolic compounds in cloves as well as leaves of winter garlic plants of the Harnas and Ornak cultivars, which are of Polish origin. Garlic was grown from cloves for three years (2018-2020) in the experimental field of the University of Agriculture in Krakow, Poland. The research material was harvested on three dates: May; June, unripe garlic plants; and in July, the plant at full maturity. The content of vitamin C in the fresh material was determined. The proximate analysis was determined in the freeze-dried plants of garlic, and the total carbohydrate content was calculated. The antioxidant activity and the content of selected polyphenolic compounds were also determined. Garlic cloves showed a higher content of dry matter, and total carbohydrates than the leaves of garlic plants. On the other hand, in the leaves, a significantly higher content of protein, total fat and ash were observed. Additionally, garlic leaves were characterised by a higher content of vitamin C, total polyphenols, and a higher antioxidant activity than garlic cloves. The leaves of young garlic plants from the May harvest were distinguished by a higher content of these compounds. The dominant phenolic compounds were catechin and epicatechin. The leaves of young plants can be a valuable source of bioactive substances, especially in early spring.
56	No evidence for seed transmission of tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus in tomato	Seed transmission is an important factor in the epidemiology of plant pathogens. Geminiviruses are serious pests spread in tropical and subtropical regions. They are transmitted by hemipteran insects, but a few cases of transmission through seeds were recently reported. Here, we investigated the tomato seed transmissibility of the begomovirus tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), one of the agents inducing the tomato yellow leaf curl disease, heavily affecting tomato crops in the Mediterranean area. None of the 180 seedlings originating from TYLCSV-infected plants showed any phenotypic alteration typical of virus infection. Moreover, whole viral genomic molecules could not be detected in their cotyledons and true leaves, neither by membrane hybridization nor by rolling-circle amplification followed by PCR, indicating that TYLCSV is not a seed-transmissible pathogen for tomato. Examining the localization of TYLCSV DNA in progenitor plants, we detected the virus genome by PCR in all vegetative and reproductive tissues, but viral genomic and replicative forms were found only in leaves, flowers and fruit flesh, not in seeds and embryos. Closer investigations allowed us to discover for the first time that these embryos were superficially contaminated by TYLCSV DNA but whole genomic molecules were not detectable. Therefore, the inability of TYLCSV genomic molecules to colonize tomato embryos during infection justifies the lack of seed transmissibility observed in this host.
57	Improving field establishment and yield in seed propagated Miscanthus through manipulating plug size, sowing date and seedling age	Biomass crops provide significant potential to substitute for fossil fuels and mitigate against climate change. It is widely acknowledged that significant scale up of biomass crops is required to help reach net zero targets. Miscanthus is a leading biomass crop embodying many characteristics that make it a highly sustainable source of biomass but planted area remains low. Miscanthus is commonly propagated via rhizome, but efficient alternatives may increase uptake and help diversify the cultivated crop. Using seed-propagate plug plants of Miscanthus has several potential benefits such as improving propagation rates and scale up of plantations. Plugs also provide an opportunity to vary the time and conditions under protected growth, to achieve optimal plantlets before planting. We varied combinations of glasshouse growth period and field planting dates under UK temperate conditions, which demonstrated the special importance of planting date on yield, stem number and establishment rates of Miscanthus. We also propagated Miscanthus in four different commercial plug designs that contained different volumes of substrate, the resulting seedlings were planted at three different dates into field trials. In the glasshouse, plug design had significant effects on above and belowground biomass accumulation and at a later time point belowground growth was restricted in some plug designs. After subsequent growth in the field, plug design and planting date had a significant effect on yield. The effects of plug design on yield were no longer significant after a second growth season but planting date continued to have a significant effect. After the second growth year, it was found that planting date had a significant effect on surviving plants, with the mid-season planting producing higher survival rates over all plug types. Establishment was positively correlated with DM biomass produced in the first growth season. Sowing date had a significant effect on establishment but the impacts of plug design were more nuanced and were significant at later planting dates. We discuss the potential to use the flexibility afforded by seed propagation of plug plants to deliver significant impacts in achieving high yield and establishment of biomass crops during the critical first two years of growth.
58	Experimental thermocline deepening highlights the resilience of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica: an opportunity to investigate shoot adaptability	The deepening of the thermocline, correlated to the rising temperature, can contribute affecting seagrass performance in a changing climate scenario. Here, the effect of the thermocline deepening on the seagrass Posidonia oceanica has been investigated in Cyprus through a manipulative experiment that allowed also testing the effects of the irradiance, origin depth and translocation. P. oceanica shoots were collected from 31 m of depth and transplanted at 12 m under a shading net, simulating the 31 m light conditions. Morphology (i.e. leaf area, leaf necrosis, number of leaves) and physiology (i.e. growth rate) were evaluated. Thermocline and origin depth effects were found with an increase of leaf necrosis, while a translocation effect was highlighted by a decrease in leaf area. No differences in shoot growth rate due to treatments were found. This experiment indicated an overall wide morphological and physiological acclimation of P. oceanica cuttings in coping with future thermocline conditions and it indirectly provides information for restoration efforts.
59	Three active phytotoxic compounds from the leaves of Albizia richardiana (Voigt.) king and prain for the development of bioherbicides to control weeds	The global population is increasing day by day. To meet the food demand for such a huge number of people, crop production must increase without damaging the environment, and to prevent synthetic chemical herbicides from polluting the environment, controlling weeds using bioherbicides is essential. Accordingly, using phytotoxic substances obtained from plants for biological weed management has attracted attention. The plant Albizia richardiana possesses phytotoxic compounds that have been previously recorded. Hence, we have conducted this research to characterize more phytotoxic compounds in Albizia richardiana. Aqueous methanolic extracts of Albizia richardiana plant significantly restricted the growth of the examined plants lettuce and Italian ryegrass in a species- and concentration-dependent manner. Three active phytotoxic compounds were isolated through various chromatographic methods and identified as compound 1, 2, and 3. Compound 3 exhibited stronger phytotoxic potentials than the other two compounds and significantly suppressed the growth of Lepidium sativum (cress). The concentration of the compounds required for 50% growth reduction (I<sub>50</sub> value) of the Lepidium sativum seedlings ranged between 0.0827 to 0.4133 mg/mL. The results suggest that these three phytotoxic compounds might contribute to the allelopathic potential of Albizia richardiana.
60	Multispecies crop mixtures increase insect biodiversity in an intercropping experiment	Recent biodiversity declines require action across sectors such as agriculture. The situation is particularly acute for arthropods, a species-rich taxon providing important ecosystem services. To counteract the negative consequences of agricultural intensification, creating a less hostile agricultural 'matrix' through growing crop mixtures can reduce harm for arthropods without yield losses. While grassland biodiversity experiments showed positive plant biodiversity effects on arthropods, experiments manipulating crop diversity and agrochemical input used to study arthropods are lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated crop diversity (1-3 species, fallows), crop species (wheat, faba bean, linseed and oilseed rape) and agrochemical input (high vs. low) and studied responses of arthropod biodiversity. We tested whether arthropod responses were affected by crop diversity, mixtures and management. Additionally, we measured crop biomass. Crop biomass increased with crop diversity under high-input management, while under low management intensity, biomass was highest in two-species mixtures. Increasing crop diversity positively affected arthropod abundance and diversity, under both low- and high-input management. Crop mixtures containing faba bean, linseed or oilseed rape had particularly high arthropod diversity. Mass-flowering crops attracted more arthropods than legumes or cereals. Integrating intercropping into agricultural systems could increase flower visits by insects up to 1.5 million per hectare, thus likely also supporting pollination and pest-control ecosystem services. Flower visitor network complexity increased in mixtures containing linseed and faba bean and under low-input management. Intercropping can counteract insect declines in farmland by creating beneficial matrix habitat without compromising crop yield.
61	Microbiological indication of soils in forest plantations of the Shirinskaya steppe	To control soil degradation and desertification, sustainable long-term protective forest plantations that perform water and soil protection functions are commonly used on the erosion-prone lands of steppe ecosystems. In the Shirinskaya dry lake-basin steppe (Khakassia) in the coastal zone of Lake Shira, the staff of the Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, has created artificial plantings of forest cultures (Pinus sylvestris L., Larix sibirica L., and Ulmus humilis L.) and provenance trials (P. sibirica Du Tour and P. sylvestris). A wildfire damaged the coastal 40-year-old forest cultures in 2015; the surface soil layer was burnt out. Agrotechnical soil cultivation for planting provenance trials (2017) and wildfire in forest cultures affected the state of soil microbiomes. The aim of the research is to assess the rate of recovery and formation of biological soil properties in forest plantations after disturbances (wildfire and agrotechnical influences) in the coastal dry-steppe zone of Lake Shira using microbiological indicators. The research objects are the Burnt Areas (postfire and postconflagration areas) and Provenance Trial Plantation sites. The use of microbial indicators shows that the soil microbiomes on the burnt sites are restored with different intensities. The recovery of soil microbiomes on the postfire sites is much faster than in the postconflagration sites, as is evidenced by the high values of the total number of microorganisms (TNM), microbial biomass (MB), enzymatic activity (EA), and humification coefficient (C<sub>h</sub>), which are close to the control values. Specific microbial respiration (qCO<sub>2</sub>) is within the range of natural variability. The burnt soil is characterized by an increased proportion of hydrolytic microorganisms actively participating in the decomposition of half-burnt plant residues. On the provenance trial sites under the pine seedlings, specific rhizosphere microbiomes are forming due to the influence of the root exudates of climatypes. The values of TNM, ETGM, MB, EA, and qCO<sub>2</sub> change either upwards or downwards; the state of microbial communities has not reached its ecophysiological norm.
62	Functional analysis of the P-type ATPases Apt2-4 from Cryptococcus neoformans by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Lipid flippases of the P4-ATPase family actively transport phospholipids across cell membranes, an activity essential for key cellular processes such as vesicle budding and membrane trafficking. Members of this transporter family have also been implicated in the development of drug resistance in fungi. The encapsulated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans contains four P4-ATPases, among which Apt2-4p are poorly characterized. Using heterologous expression in the flippase-deficient S. cerevisiae strain dnf1dnf2drs2, we tested their lipid flippase activity in comparison to Apt1p using complementation tests and fluorescent lipid uptake assays. Apt2p and Apt3p required the co-expression of the C. neoformans Cdc50 protein for activity. Apt2p/Cdc50p displayed a narrow substrate specificity, limited to phosphatidylethanolamine and -choline. Despite its inability to transport fluorescent lipids, the Apt3p/Cdc50p complex still rescued the cold-sensitive phenotype of dnf1dnf2drs2, suggesting a functional role for the flippase in the secretory pathway. Apt4p, the closest homolog to Saccharomyces Neo1p, which does not require a Cdc50 protein, was unable to complement several flippase-deficient mutant phenotypes, neither in the presence nor absence of a beta-subunit. These results identify C. neoformans Cdc50 as an essential subunit for Apt1-3p and provide a first insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying their physiological functions.
63	Formation of seed potato yield depending on the elements of cultivation technology	It is possible to realise the maximum genetic potential of modern potato varieties by improving the elements of agricultural technology, in particular, optimising plant nutrition, which determines the relevance of this study. The purpose of the study was to substantiate the specific features of potato productivity formation depending on the elements of growing technology in Forest-Steppe conditions. Field studies were conducted during 2019-2021 on chernozem soils. The features of growth and development of potato varieties of various ripeness groups Laperla, Granada, and Memphis in Forest-Steppe conditions are examined. It is established that the yield of potato seed tubers of the varieties under study varies depending on the dose and method of fertilisation, the fraction of planting tubers, and varietal characteristics. The highest indicators of individual productivity of potato plants of the Laperla, Granada, and Memphis varieties were formed when locally applied in rows N45R45K45 against the background of semi-rotted manure, phosphorus-potassium fertiliser, and the use of seed tubers with a fraction of >60 mm. As a result of the action of the factors under study, the number of stems in the bush and under it increased. A strong direct correlation was established between the number of stems in the bush and the number of tubers (r=0.78), with a coefficient of determination of 61.0%. The maximum yield of potato tubers of the examined potato varieties (29.7-41.1 t/ha) was obtained by local application of N45R45K45 against the background of semi-rotted manure and phosphorus-potassium fertiliser, depending on the size of seed tubers by the largest transverse diameter. It was identified that the use of tubers with a fraction of >60 mm for planting the potato varieties under study is irrational since the consumption of seed material exceeds the yield growth indicators. It was determined that Laperla, Granada, and Memphis tubers with a fraction of 28-60 mm are optimal for planting potato varieties of different ripeness groups. The research results can be used to adjust the elements of agricultural technology of seed potatoes, obtain high-quality planting material, and conduct profitable agribusiness.
64	Low-density polyethylene film biodegradation potential by fungal species from Thailand	Accumulated plastic waste in the environment is a serious problem that poses an ecological threat. Plastic waste has been reduced by initiating and applying different alternative methods from several perspectives, including fungal treatment. Biodegradation of 30 fungi from Thailand were screened in mineral salt medium agar containing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films. Diaporthe italiana, Thyrostroma jaczewskii, Collectotrichum fructicola, and Stagonosporopsis citrulli were found to grow significantly by culturing with LDPE film as the only sole carbon source compared to those obtained from Aspergillus niger. These fungi were further cultured in mineral salt medium broth containing LDPE film as the sole carbon source for 90 days. The biodegradation ability of these fungi was evaluated from the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and enzyme production. Different amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> were released from D. italiana, T. jaczewskii, C. fructicola, S. citrulli, and A. niger culturing with LDPE film, ranging from 0.45 to 1.45, 0.36 to 1.22, 0.45 to 1.45, 0.33 to 1.26, and 0.37 to 1.27 g/L, respectively. These fungi were able to secrete a large amount of laccase enzyme compared to manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase enzymes detected under the same conditions. The degradation of LDPE films by culturing with these fungi was further determined. LDPE films cultured with D. italiana, T. jaczewskii, C. fructicola, S. citrulli, and A. niger showed weight loss of 43.90%, 46.34%, 48.78%, 45.12%, and 28.78%, respectively. The tensile strength of LDPE films cultured with D. italiana, T. jaczewskii, C. fructicola, S. citrulli, and A. niger also reduced significantly by 1.56, 1.78, 0.43, 1.86, and 3.34 MPa, respectively. The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveal an increasing carbonyl index in LDPE films culturing with these fungi, especially C. fructicola. Analysis of LDPE films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the biodegradation by the presence of morphological changes such as cracks, scions, and holes on the surface of the film. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from LDPE films cultured with these fungi were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). VOCs such as 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene, 1,3-dimethoxy-5-(1-methylethyl)-benzene, and 1,1-dimethoxy-decane were detected among these fungi. Overall, these fungi have the ability to break down and consume the LDPE film. The fungus C. fructicola is a promising resource for the biodegradation of LDPE which may be further applied in plastic degradation systems based on fungi.
65	Bot gummosis of lemon (Citrus x limon) caused by Neofusicoccum parvum	Neofusicoccum parvum, in the family Botryosphaeriaceae, was identified as the causal agent of bot gummosis of lemon (Citrus x limon) trees, in the two major lemon-producing regions in Italy. Gummy cankers on trunk and scaffold branches of mature trees were the most typical disease symptoms. Neofusicoccum parvum was the sole fungus constantly and consistently isolated from the canker bark of symptomatic lemon trees. It was identified on the basis of morphological characters and the phylogenetic analysis of three loci, i.e., the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) as well as the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) and beta-tubulin (TUB2) genes. The pathogenicity of N. parvum was demonstrated by wound inoculating two lemon cultivars, 'Femminello 2kr' and 'Monachello', as well as citrange (C. sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata) 'Carrizo' rootstock. In artificial inoculations, the fungus was very aggressive on lemons and weakly virulent on citrange, consistently with symptoms observed in the field as a consequence of natural infections. This is the first report of N. parvum, both in a wide and in a strict taxonomic sense, as a pathogen of lemon in Italy.
66	Low efficacy of Isaria fumosorosea against box tree moth Cydalima perspectalis: are host plant phytochemicals involved in herbivore defence against fungal pathogens?	Buxus sp. is an important native and ornamental tree in Europe threatened by a serious invasive pest Cydalima perspectalis. The larvae of this moth are able to defoliate box trees and cause their death. The development of novel biopesticides targeting this pest might help protect Buxus trees grown wildly or in city parks. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungus Isaria fumosorosea strain CCM 8367 against C. perspectalis. The last-instar larvae of the box tree moth were treated by the suspension of fungus conidia at concentrations ranging from 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> spores per 1 mL. Fungus infection was observed mostly in pupae, but the maximum mortality did not exceed 60%, indicating a very low susceptibility of C. perspectalis to I. fumosorosea. Furthermore, a number of ungerminated fungal conidia were found on larval cuticles using a low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. Our data also reveal that the hydroalcoholic extract from B. sempervirens leaves significantly inhibits both the germination of I. fumosorosea conidia and fungus growth. It can be speculated that the strain CCM 8367 of I. fumosorosea is not a potent biocontrol agent against C. perspectalis and low virulence of the fungus might be due to the accumulation of host plant phytochemicals having antimicrobial activity in larval cuticle of the pest.
67	Defaunation changes leaf trait composition of recruit communities in tropical forests in French Guiana	Hunting impacts tropical vertebrate populations, causing declines of species that function as seed dispersers and predators, or that browse seedlings and saplings. Whether and how the resulting reductions in seed dispersal, seed predation, and browsing translate to changes in the tree composition is poorly understood. Here, we assess the effect of defaunation on the functional composition of communities of tree recruits in tropical rainforests in French Guiana. We selected eight sites along a gradient of defaunation, caused by differences in hunting pressure, in otherwise intact old-growth forests in French Guiana. We measured shifts in functional composition by comparing leaf and fruit traits and wood density between tree recruits (up to 5 cm diameter at breast height) and adults, and tested whether and how these compositional shifts related to defaunation. We found a positive relationship with defaunation for shifts in specific leaf area, a negative relationship for shifts of leaf toughness and wood density, and a weak relationship for shifts in fruit traits. Our results suggest that the loss of vertebrates affects ecological processes such as seed dispersal and browsing, of which browsing remains understudied. Even though these changes sometimes seem minor, together they result in major shifts in forest composition. These changes have long-term ramifications that may alter forest dynamics for generations.
68	Disentangling the effects of biomass and productivity in plant competition	The relationship between competition and productivity in plant communities is unclear, and this is likely to be due to (1) a confusion in the literature between productivity and biomass, (2) the lack of studies assessing variation in competition in all combinations of biomass and productivity. We assessed the outcome of plant-plant interactions by removing the neighbors around five focal species in 14 herbaceous communities with contrasting biomasses and productivities: meadows with high biomass and productivity, heathlands with high biomass and low productivity, understory communities of deciduous forests with low biomass and high productivity and calcareous grasslands with low biomass and low productivity. Competition intensity was quantified with the relative interaction index (RII) calculated for both survival and growth of the transplanted targets assessed with the increase in leaf number. To examine which traits better explain variation in competition and what drives variation in diversity, we also quantified litter decomposition rate, species composition and diversity and six morphological traits related to plant size and growth rate for eight dominant species of each community. Our main questions were: (1) Is competition mostly related to biomass or productivity? (2) Which traits of the community dominants better explain variation in competition? (3) Is variation in competition and related traits correlated with variation in diversity? Competition for survival significantly increased with increasing community biomass (but not productivity). In addition, competition for survival increased with the size traits and competitive effects of the dominant species of the communities, whereas diversity decreased. Competition for growth also increased with increasing productivity, but only for high-biomass communities. Additionally, the increase in competition for growth with increasing soil fertility, as measured with litter decomposition rate, was only due to an increase in target growth in plots without neighbors and was unrelated to community competitive effects and species diversity. The results of our study illustrate how the confusion between productivity and biomass could have contributed to the long-standing debate on variation in competition along productivity gradients and its consequence for diversity.
69	Adding fish waste to the diet of Iceland scallop Chlamys islandica: effects on feeding and reproductive ability	Organic enrichment from fish farming may impact benthic species and habitats in adjacent areas. Norwegian salmon farming is continuously growing, but, due to area conflicts and severe sea-lice problems in the western areas, growth of the industry is focused in the northern areas. Knowledge is scarce on how an increase in fish farming will impact Arctic and subarctic species and habitats. One such species is the Iceland scallop Chlamys islandica, distributed from the Lofoten Islands in Nordland County to the Varangerfjord in Troms and Finnmark County. To study the impact of fine-particle fish faeces on feeding and reproductive ability in adult Iceland scallop, particles < 41 m of finfish waste were added to the diet. Effects were tested via shortterm (weeks) feeding studies using 2 diets, 100% cultured algal species and a 50% mix of algae and fish waste. In addition, a 100% fish waste diet was used to study longer-term effects on reproductive ability (months). Feeding (% particle clearance and feeding rate) on the microalgae diet tended to be higher than that on the diet containing fish waste, but the difference was significant only in 2 out of 4 cases. We did not find any effect of diets on reproductive ability (gonad development and fatty acid profiles) of scallops. Lack of knowledge on sufficient food levels for gonad maturation in this species may have affected the results. We suggest that future work includes the transplant of scallops from a reference site to fish production sites and that investigations begin immediately after spawning early in scallop gonad development.
70	Chemical composition of tissues of Syringa vulgaris L. and soil features in abandoned cemeteries	Abandoned anthropogenic sites are transformed when they come into use. In the present study, such objects were abandoned Evangelical cemeteries located in the Land of the Great Mazurian Lakes (northern Poland). This study aims to compare the concentrations of selected major (Ca, Na, Mg, Al, Fe) and potentially toxic elements (Zn, Cd, Pb) in the roots, leaves, and branches of Syringa vulgaris and buried necrosols and unburied soils in which this species grows. The soils analysed differ in their profile structure; in the case of burial necrosols, anthropogenic layers are present, while Brunic Arenosol has a natural horizon arrangement. Regarding pH, the soils analysed are characterised in the weakly acidic (6.6-6.8) to alkaline (7.2-8.6) range, both in KCl and H<sub>2</sub>O. Total phosphorus has high values in the humus and anthropogenic horizons, especially at coffin sites (Rudowka Mala: layer of Ccoffin - 759 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>; Szymonka - 844 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>). Necrosols are characterised by a slightly higher variation in major element content than soils outside the burial area. The highest elemental content in Syringa vulgaris is accumulated in leaves and roots. Potassium (K) has the highest content in the studied tissues, and cadmium (Cd) is the lowest. The study showed no significant differences in heavy metal accumulation for plants directly associated with necrosols and soils formed outside of burials, which is confirmed by analyses of environmental indicators. The study showed that plant chemistry is more influenced by the soil substrate and soil-forming process than the soil anthropogenisation associated with burials. There was no significant effect of burials on the chemical composition of individual parts of Syringa vulgaris.
71	Application of real-time PCR for the detection and quantification of oomycetes in ornamental nursery stock	Numerous Phytophthora and Pythium disease outbreaks have occurred in Europe following inadvertent introduction of contaminated ornamental plants. Detection and identification of pathogens are crucial to reduce risks and improve plant biosecurity in Europe and globally. Oomycete diversity present in roots and compost was determined in 99 hardy woody plants bought from nurseries, retailers and internet sellers, using both isolations and molecular analyses. Oomycete DNA was quantified using real-time PCR of environmental DNA from the plants using three loci: ITS, trnM-trnP-trnM and atp9-nad9. At least one oomycete species was isolated from 89.9% of plants using classical techniques. In total, 10 Phytophthora spp., 17 Pythium spp. and 5 Phytopythium spp. were isolated. Oomycetes were isolated from 86% of asymptomatic plants, but real-time PCR demonstrated that oomycetes were associated with all plants tested. More oomycete DNA occurred in composts in comparison with roots and filters from baiting water (a mean of 7.91 ng g<sup>-1</sup>, 6.55 x 10<sup>-1</sup> ng g<sup>-1</sup> and 5.62 x 10<sup>-1</sup> ng g<sup>-1</sup> of oomycete DNA detected in compost with ITS, trnM and atp9 probes, respectively); the ITS probe detected the highest quantities of oomycete DNA. No significant differences were found in quantities of oomycete DNA detected using real-time PCR in plants purchased online or from traditional retailers.
72	Major transcriptomic differences are induced by warmer temperature conditions experienced during asexual and sexual reproduction in Fragaria vesca ecotypes	A major challenge for plants in a rapidly changing climate is to adapt to rising temperatures. Some plants adapt to temperature conditions by generating an epigenetic memory that can be transmitted both meiotically and mitotically. Such epigenetic memories may increase phenotypic variation to global warming and provide time for adaptation to occur through classical genetic selection. The goal of this study was to understand how warmer temperature conditions experienced during sexual and asexual reproduction affect the transcriptomes of different strawberry (Fragaria vesca) ecotypes. We let four European F. vesca ecotypes reproduce at two contrasting temperatures (18 and 28 degrees C), either asexually through stolon formation for several generations, or sexually by seeds (achenes). We then analyzed the transcriptome of unfolding leaves, with emphasis on differential expression of genes belonging to the epigenetic machinery. For asexually reproduced plants we found a general transcriptomic response to temperature conditions but for sexually reproduced plants we found less significant responses. We predicted several splicing isoforms for important genes (e.g. a SOC1, LHY, and SVP homolog), and found significantly more differentially presented splicing event variants following asexual vs. sexual reproduction. This difference could be due to the stochastic character of recombination during meiosis or to differential creation or erasure of epigenetic marks during embryogenesis and seed development. Strikingly, very few differentially expressed genes were shared between ecotypes, perhaps because ecotypes differ greatly both genetically and epigenetically. Genes related to the epigenetic machinery were predominantly upregulated at 28 degrees C during asexual reproduction but downregulated after sexual reproduction, indicating that temperature-induced change affects the epigenetic machinery differently during the two types of reproduction.
73	Changes to volatile profiles of arborvitae, Thuja occidentalis, from drought and insect infestation: olfactory cues for the cypress bark beetle, Phloeosinus aubei	The cypress bark beetle, Phloeosinus aubei (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) prefers to build breeding galleries in decaying host trees. However, volatile cues specific to decaying or actively infested trees have not yet been reported. Any such information would be useful for the management of this invasive, wood-boring species that has become established across Europe in the temperate zone and is now a key pest of ornamental Cupressaceae in nurseries and urban landscapes. Our objective was to reveal key components in host volatiles specific to stressed trees, which could be potential signals for the pest of its suitability for colonisation. Volatile profiles of arborvitae, Thuja occidentalis 'Smaragd' suffering from either dehydration or fresh infestation of P. aubei was collected and compared to that samples from healthy control trees. Analyses of volatiles by gas chromatography coupled to an electroantennographic detector revealed substantial differences between healthy, dehydrated and infested trees. Structural elucidation of the major antennally active components revealed that both a-pinene and a-thujene were prevalent in the volatiles of infested trees, whilst a-thujone was the major component in volatiles of healthy trees. In volatiles collected from trunks housing fresh P. aubei female nuptial chambers, sharp increases of beta-pinene, myrcene, limonene, and p-cymene were noticed, alongside trace amounts of camphene and fenchene. Volatiles collected from fresh frass showed a similar profile, but with a somewhat smaller amount of limonene. Fenchone was present in each type of volatiles, however, only in low amounts. Further studies should be directed to reveal the behavioural role of these components, which could be helpful in developing kairomone-based techniques for monitoring the flight of the pest in stands of scale-leafed trees.
74	Traditional herbal drugs against liver diseases - experimented in vitro using HepG2 cells for induced steatosis	Salvia fruticosa leaves, Malva sylvestris flowers, Taraxacum officinale aerial parts, Plantago ovata seeds, Tanacetum parthenium aerial parts, and Allium sativum bulbs are documented for traditional use against hepatic disorders and different liver diseases. To evaluate herbal drug material for potential use against liver diseases, at molecular level for the efficacy linked to ethnobotanical documented data. Different herbal extracts were prepared and standardized by HPLC, according to European Pharmacopoeia. Initially 0.25 mg/mL each standardized extract was applied to oleic+palmitic acid induced fatty liver using a HepG2 cell culture model. ALT, AST, GSH, and MDA levels were comparatively analyzed, in addition to cell Nil Red staining. The highest activity for MDA reduction was observed for the A. sativum extract at 48.2% level, followed by 36.4% for M. sylvestris, and S. fruticosa extracts with 27.3% reduction, respectively. Glutathione levels increased to 59.1% when A. sativum extract was applied. M. sylvestris extract increased the glutathione levels in the medium by 49.7%; S. fruticosa extract decreased ALT levels by 53.5% and M. sylvestris extract by 38.5%, whereas the standard resveratrol reduced ALT level by 30.9%, respectively. The AST levels for M. sylvestris extract was 46.5%, compared to resveratrol by 93%. A. sativum, M. sylvestris, and S. fruticosa standard extracts showed relatively good correlation and activity where further in vivo studies should be performed.
75	First report of canna yellow streak virus in Iran	Canna indica (canna) a species in the Cannaceae family, is a perennial ornamental plant widely used in landscape designing. Different species of plant viruses have been reported which infect this plant and act as a significant threat to canna plants, leading to a range of symptoms and a decrease in their decorative values, as well as lower quality propagated materials and significant financial losses. Canna cultivars that are extensively cultivated for their ornamental values are susceptible to a recently discovered Potyvirus known as canna yellow streak virus (CaYSV). This virus has infected many canna cultivars found in gardens, leading to significant impact and concern in horticultural settings. During a survey conducted in the summer of 2022, severe veinal chlorosis and veinal streaking symptoms were observed on the leaves of canna plants in the green space of Yazd City, Iran. Total genomic RNA was extracted from symptomatic leaves of 20 canna samples and one symptomless sample (negative control), and subjected to RT-PCR using a Potyvirus degenerate primer pair (NIb3R, NIb2F). RT-PCR resulted in the amplification of a DNA fragment with the expected size of approximately 350 bp in all of the symptomatic samples, whereas no DNA fragment was obtained from a symptomless plant. The amplified DNA fragment was subjected to the Sanger sequencing method, and its size was confirmed to be exactly 350 bp. Sequence analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this amplicon with the same region of other corresponding CaYSV isolates in the GenBank revealed that the Iranian CaYSV isolate was the most similar (99.05%) to an isolate from Russia (Acc. No. MG_545919.1) and the less similar (89.59%) to a CaYSV isolate from United Kingdom (Acc. No. EF_466139.1).
76	Same, same, but different: drought and salinity affect BVOC emission rate and alter blend composition of urban trees	Drought and salt are key abiotic stressors in temperate cities. Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, often dominated by trees, influence the urban troposphere and mediate plant-plant and plant-insect interactions. While knowledge on constitutive BVOC emissions is increasing, modulation of blends by stress has yet received little attention. We thus investigated BVOC blends and herbivore-related subsets ('bouquets') of Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Betula pendula and Carpinus betulus seedlings under control, and after 2-weeks of drought and salt stress using PTR-Tof-MS. 22 BVOCs were related to metabolic pathways, and changes among blends and bouquets were assessed. Drought led to a slight increase of isoprene and monoterpene emissions from Q. robur and F. sylvatica, respectively, while total non-isoprene emissions generally declined under water stress. Both drought and salinity led to distinct, species-specific changes in the emission rates of single BVOCs, and resulted in markedly different herbivore-related bouquets in F. sylvatica and C. betulus. Oxygenated VOCs and green leaf volatiles in particular increased in these two salt-sensitive species, while pathway-specific effects were less clear under drought. Findings indicate significant consequences of common urban stressors on BVOC emission spectra, including tropospheric ozone formation and severely hampered plant communication cues under stress.
77	Severe dieback and mortality of wild olive trees associated with Phytophthora species in Italy	In March 2022, extensive dieback and mortality of wild olive trees (Olea europaea var. sylvestris) were observed in an area of approximately 200 hectares located in central Sardinia, Italy. The affected trees exhibited severe symptoms, including leaf chlorosis, wilting, defoliation of the entire crown and root rot. Many of the trees displayed necrotic lesions on their feeder roots. The estimated tree mortality in the affected area was approximately 60%, with an 80% disease incidence. To investigate the cause of this dieback and mortality, soil samples were collected from the rhizosphere of 16 unhealthy wild olive trees. A baiting technique was employed using fresh Ceratonia siliqua leaves as bait. Additionally, isolations were made by plating small fragments of root phloem tissue from lesion margins onto Phytophthora selective medium (SMA). The analysis consistently revealed the presence of a homothallic Phytophthora species in 14 of the sampled trees. An additional Phytophthora species was detected in the rhizosphere of 4 diseased trees. Further characterization of the Phytophthora species involved DNA sequencing of the ITS and cox1 genes. The obtained sequences showed a high degree of identity (99-100%) with sequences of ex-type cultures of P. bilorbang (CBS131653) and P. pseudocryptogea (CBS139749). To confirm the pathogenicity of both Phytophthora species, inoculation experiments were conducted using 6-month-old wild olive seedlings and the soil infestation method. Three weeks after inoculation with P. bilorbang and P. pseudocryptogea, all seedlings displayed symptoms of wilting and dieback. Additionally, the fine root weight of inoculated plants was significantly reduced compared to non-inoculated controls. Both Phytophthora species was subsequently re-isolated from the necrotic roots of inoculated seedlings, satisfying Koch's postulates. This is thought to be the first report of P. bilorbang on wild olive worldwide.
78	Morpho-physiological effects of irrigation with saline water in Ex vitro plants of Juglans regia 'Sorrento'	Soil salinization is a global problem limiting growth and economical yield in fruit species including walnut. Knowledge of the response of varieties and cultivars to salinity can represent an important contribution to future walnut plantation in areas affected by soil salinization. Juglans regia 'Sorrento' is a commercially important Italian variety. The present work aimed to explore the morpho-physiological response to NaCl-induced stress in 'Sorrento' plants using clonally propagated ex vitro plantlets to reduce the impact of genetic variation. Ex vitro acclimatized plants were exposed to salinity conditions by irrigating pot soil with half-strength Hoagland solution containing 100 mM NaCl for 20 days. Salt-induced effects on plant growth, chlorophyll and carotenoid content, osmolality, membrane injury and on activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD) in leaves were evaluated. Morphological and growth parameters were not significantly altered by salt stress with respect to the control. Slight differences in leaf necrosis and absence of injury in the membranes, stable content of photosynthetic pigments, and an increase in G-POD activity were also found in salt-treated plants. These results collectively suggest that 'Sorrento' has potential for the cultivation in salinized environments.
79	Masting increases seedling recruitment near and far: predator satiation and improved dispersal in a fleshy-fruited tree	The animal dispersal hypothesis predicts that mast seeding can increase dispersal rate of seeds by dispersers and enhance reproductive success of plants. However, in contrast to pollination efficiency and predator satiation hypothesis, the animal dispersal hypothesis has received mixed support. Using 12-year data on fruit production and seedling recruitment of a fleshy-fruited tree rowan (Sorbus aucuparia, Rosaceae), we tested if an increase in the fruit production at the population level results in higher proportion of fruits recruiting into seedlings. Recruitment was recorded near (under rowans) and far (under heterospecifics) from conspecifics. Higher recruitment rates under rowans would support predator satiation hypothesis. Higher recruitment rates under heterospecific trees, where fruits can only arrive with animal assistance, would support animal dispersal hypothesis. High population-level fruit production increased the proportion of fruits recruiting into seedlings both near and far from rowans. In contrast, high individual-level fruit production did not have a positive effect on the proportion of fruits recruiting into seedlings. Synthesis. Population-level synchronisation of fruit production is required to generate a more effective plant regeneration. Our findings show that masting enhances seedling recruitment through predator satiation and increased seed dispersal by frugivores. The results provide support for both animal dispersal and predator satiation hypotheses indicating that both mechanisms can operate simultaneously.
80	Possibilities of increasing biodiversity in the genus Elaeagnus L. during reproduction by soft cuttings	In this article, for the first time in Russia, the reproduction results of four species of the genus Elaeagnus L. by soft cuttings are presented comparatively. The promising genus of Elaeagnus L. have been identified in terms of fruiting and ornamentally. Their reproduction methods by soft cuttings with growth regulators, which make it possible to obtain high-quality seedlings for planting plantations, have been studied. Experiments on reproduction by soft cuttings were carried out in 2018 - 2020 on the territory of the Fruit Station of the RSAU-Moscow Agricultural Academy, named after K.A. Timiryazev. The cuttings were treated with three different growth regulators, stimulants of root formation (IMA-indolylbutyric acid), GHC-hydroxycinnamic acid (Zircon), and BCI + GGA (Universal rooting agent) and water was used as a control. The obtained results were processed by analysis of variance, as a result of which the morphological variability of rooted soft cuttings was revealed when treated with growth and development regulators. It was found that the genotype and stimulants significantly affect the average length and number of roots, the growth of shoots, their number, and the number of leaves on the shoot. The most effective was the growth and development regulator GKK + IMC. The results obtained make it possible to increase the biodiversity of valuable genotypes of the genus Elaeagnus L.
81	Bryophytes of Europe Traits (BET) data set: a fundamental tool for ecological studies	Bryophytes are a diverse group of organisms with unique properties, yet they are severely underrepresented in plant trait databases. Building on the recently published European Red List of bryophytes and previous trait compilations, we present the Bryophytes of Europe Traits (BET) data set, including biological traits such as those related to life history, growth habit, sexual and vegetative reproduction; ecological traits such as indicator values, substrate and habitat; and bioclimatic variables based on the species' European range. The data set includes values for 65 traits and 25 bioclimatic variables, containing more than 135,000 trait values with a completeness of 82.7% on average. The data set will enable future studies in bryophyte biology, ecology and conservation, and may help to answer fundamental questions in bryology.
82	Tarenaya cultivars: genome size and genetic diversity	The spider flower, Tarenaya hassleriana (syn. Cleome spinosa), belongs to the family Cleomaceae, that originates in South America and is used as ornamental plant. Cultivar series were bred on a small scale, but showed low morphological diversity. The used gene pool and the hybridization steps carried out are largely unknown, but it is assumed that T. hassleriana was involved. Therefore, genome size as well as morphological and genetic diversity of seven generatively and ten vegetatively propagated cultivars were determined. Also T. boliviensis was included in the study. A field trial performed in 2021 at the Saxon State Office for Environment, Agriculture and Geology in Dresden, Germany, showed better flowering performance and overall impression for vegetatively propagated in comparison to the seed-propagated cultivars. To estimate the genetic distance, 168 individual bands from RAPD/dpRAPD analysis provided a clear distinction between T. boliviensis and the cultivars as well as between the groups of vegetatively and seed-propagated cultivars. Within the cultivar groups the genetic variation was found to be highly reduced. Three biological replicates of leaves and petals were measured with the flow cytometer CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter). The 2C DNA contents were calculated using the internal standard tomato 'Stupicke' and the software CytExpert 2.3. Mean 2C values could be distinguished into two main groups. Group 1 varied from 0.64 to 0.67 pg and included all generatively and three vegetatively propagated cultivars. Group 2 varied from 0.92 to 1.01 pg and consisted of seven cultivars and T. boliviensis. These results support further breeding and the enhancement of variability of ornamental Tarenaya.
83	Compatibility of interspecific hybridization between tulip cultivars and wild species native to China	Interspecific hybridization is an important means of breeding new cultivars with novel characteristics introduced from their parents. The interspecific hybridization was carried out between five tulip cultivars 'Heart of Poland', 'Golden Parade', 'Purple Dream', 'Crystal Star', 'Bolroyal Dream' and wild specie Tulipa altaica. In five combinations, the compatibility was observed including pollen germinability, stigma receptivity, fruit-setting, hybrid seed germination and bulblet formation in this paper. The results showed that T. altaica has the highest germination rate (69.58%) compared with any other parents. The highest stigmatic receptivity of five female cultivars was recorded on 10:00 am one day after flowering. The crosses of 'Heart of Poland' x T. altaica and 'Bolroyal Dream' x T. altaica displayed a higher percentage of fruit setting with 79.32 and 82.23%, respectively. A total of 698 hybrid seeds were obtained from interspecific hybridization combinations, including 'Heart of Poland' x T. altaica, 'Purple dream' x T. altaica and 'Bolroyal Dream' x T. altaica. In contrast, other two crosses were completely unsuccessful when 'Golden Parade' and 'Crystal Star' were used as female parents. The higher rates of seed germination and bulblet formation were recorded in two crosses with 63.45 and 55.63% in 'Heart of Poland' x T. altaica, 58.35 and 61.88% in 'Bolroyal Dream' x T. altaica. The results of this paper could provide some useful information about the interspecific cross between T. altaica and tulip cultivars.
84	Flower morphology and biometrical aspects in rolB and ORF13a Kalanchoe blossfeldiana 'Molly' lines	Kalanchoe blossfeldiana and its derived hybrids comprise one of the most important potted plants in Europe and ranks first in Denmark's best-selling ornamental species. There is a strong market for Kalanchoe and consumers have an increasing demand for novelty and high quality of Kalanchoe products. At the same time, the flower morphology plays a crucial role in the breeding of new varieties. Breeding new traits using natural transformation with Rhizobium rhizogenes successfully introduced compact growth in Kalanchoe by introgression of transfer-DNA fragments of the root-inducing (Ri) plasmid into plants during bacterial infection. However, the role and function of individual root oncogenic loci (rol)-genes and open reading frames (ORFs) from R. rhizogenes basically remains unclear. This work aimed at investigating the effect of individual constructs overexpressing rolB and ORF13a in K. blossfeldiana 'Molly' by assessing biometrical and flower morphology features. Plants transformed with rolB and ORF13a had 30 and 37% lower height compared to wild type (WT), respectively 90 days after propagation. The rolB line plant diameter exhibited a reduction of 25% while ORF13a was 34% reduced in comparison to WT. Additionally, the leaf number of rolB and ORF13a was reduced to 40% less in comparison to WT. Moreover, the flower morphology of rolB and ORF13a showed markedly distinct flower shape compared to the WT. The transgenic lines exhibited lobose corollas, where the four petals were fan-shaped. In addition, the edges of petals from transgenic lines were not smooth as WT, presenting curly and irregular edges. Therefore, transformation with the single constructs of rolB and ORF13a resulted in different compactness levels between the transgenic lines of K. blossfeldiana 'Molly', demonstrating that unexplored ORFs could also present a novel genetic pool in terms of dwarfed phenotypes.
85	Induced drought affects morphological and eco-physiological response of Mediterranean wild roses	Water scarcity for the irrigation of ornamental crops is a typical phenomenon of nursery activities in the south Mediterranean districts and has frequently detrimental effects on plant growth, yield and quality. Wild roses are generally hardy plants with high ornamental potentialities and possible tolerance to the main abiotic stresses typical of their native environments. Therefore, a greenhouse experiment was carried out with the aim to evaluate growing and qualitative response of two Sicilian rose species to increasing deficit irrigation. Rooted-cuttings plants of Rosa canina L. and R. sempervirens L. were grown in 4-L plastic containers under drought stress induced by progressively reducing the irrigation volumes (900, 600 and 300 mL plant<sup>-1</sup>) during each irrigation. Morphological and eco-physiological parameters were measured throughout the experiment. Increasing irrigation deficit resulted in a decrease of plant growth (at canopy and root level), ornamental effect, biomass yield and partitioning, stem water potential, leaf net photosynthesis and transpiration; this behavior was more evident in R. canina than in R. sempervirens potted plants. The identification of wild roses tolerant to moderate drought may allow to use them for ornamental nursery production and for landscaping in south Mediterranean areas often characterized by a low availability of the irrigation water.
86	How the physical properties of the leaves of common plants affect dependent acoustic characterization in urban areas of Istanbul, Turkey	To date, several ecological studies have addressed the influences of environmental noise. However, fundamental studies on noise reduction depending on the acoustic characterization of natural materials are still lacking. The present study quantitatively evaluates experimental data on sound absorption and attenuation of untreated plant leaves commonly found in urban areas. The leaves of English Ivy (Hedera helix L.), Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), Hortensia (Hydrangea macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser.), Japanese Privet (Ligustrum japonicum Thunb.), Laurel (Laurus nobilis L.), Linden (Tilia tomentosa Moench), Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.), Osmanthus (Osmanthus heterophyllus (G. Don) P.S. Green), Plane Tree (Platanus orientalis L.), and Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) were collected from branches of healthy plants grown under identical climate and soil conditions. To acoustically characterize plant leaves, impedance tube and pulse-echo techniques were used to experimentally determine the normal incidence sound absorption coefficient (SAC), speed of sound and sound attenuation coefficient (SC) values, respectively. In addition, as more effective numerical outputs, the normalized SAC (SAC') and normalized NRC (NRC') values were calculated by empirical modelling. As a statistical approach, multiple regression was also conducted to predict the dependent acoustic variables based on the independent physical parameters of the samples.
87	Effects of species and varietal differences on intergeneric cross-compatibility between apple and pear	Hybridization across species and genus has been utilized to improve agriculturally important traits in crops. These interspecific and intergeneric hybridizations are often inhibited by reproductive barriers at the prezygotic and postzygotic stages. In this study, we used intergeneric hybridization between apple and pear to investigate the effects of species and varietal differences on pollen tube growth, seed germination, and seedling survival in a wide range of germplasms . In apple pistils pollinated by pears, inferior pollen tube growth was often observed for European pear cultivars, whereas hybrid seedlings derived from a cross between apple and European pear showed higher survival rate. In contrast, Japanese pear and Chinese pear pollination resulted in higher fruit setting which likely resulted from a higher rate of compatible pistils but a lower rate of seedling survival. Our results suggest the presence of both prezygotic and postzygotic barriers that occur independently in different crossing combinations. We also developed a Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence marker for detecting intergeneric hybrids derived from a wide range of crosses between apples and pears. The results of the present study will help in the development of intergeneric hybrids between apple and pear for introducing valuable traits from a diverse gene pool.
88	Investigating the effects of fish effluents as organic fertilisers on onion (Allium cepa) yield, soil nutrients, and soil microbiome	Although waste waters from aquaculture farms, known as fish effluents, have been shown to be a viable source of nutrients for crop production, their use is not permitted in organic production under the current European regulatory framework, Council Regulation (EU) 2018/848. In contrast, the use of livestock manure as fertiliser is allowed and indeed encouraged. In this work we tested the effects of two types of fish effluents - filtered and unfiltered fish waters - from an aquaponic system on the yield of onions (Allium cepa) and the soil nutrients and microbiome, compared with a fertilisation regime using composted horse manure. Soil fertility was enhanced by the addition of fish effluents, in particular in the soil treated with unfiltered fish water or sludge, which resulted in the soil with the highest nitrate content. Fertilisation with fish water and aerobically treated fish sludge resulted in higher yields than the manure, performing the best in all growth and yield measurements. The bulb weight and bulb diameter in the onions fertilised with manure were 102.43 g +or- 7.26 and 61 mm +or- 2.05 respectively, the ones fertilised with filtered fish effluents were 126 g +or- 6.64 and 66.52 mm +or- 2.17, and the ones fertilised with filtered (fish water) and unfiltered (sludge) fish effluents were 133.32 g +or- 6.86 and 67.66 mm +or- 1.81. The horse manure significantly affected the microbial community structure of the soil, resulting in a higher species diversity compared with the fish effluents, with the most predominant genus types being Flavobacterium, Pseudarthrobacter, Sphingomonas, Massilia, Nitrososphaera, Pseudomonas and Nocardioides. However, the microbial activity in the soil with fish effluents was also significant, which indicates that the soil treated in this way can be considered a 'living soil', as required for organic certification in the EU. Overall, the results confirm the findings of previous studies on the effectiveness of fish effluents as fertilisers, and highlight the superior performance of fish effluents compared with a livestock manure, thus directly questioning the prohibition on using fish effluents in organic agriculture.
89	Comparison of the biomass and dendrometric parameters of Norway spruce with its different representations in young stands at lower altitudes in the Czech Republic	"In forestry, it is still common to plant the seedlings of and cultivate Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) at lower altitudes; however, the climatic change that has been occurring increases evaporative demands in these areas. As a result, the spruce evidently suffers from drought, withers and loses its power to grow, thus, influencing stem thickness and tree-height growth, as well as biomass production. Therefore, the growth and biomass production of young (5-, 15- and 25-year-old) Norway spruce stands at these altitudes (i.e., from 200 to 500 m a.s.l.) was surveyed, as a case study, across the Training Forest Enterprise ""Masaryk Forest"" Krtiny. There, 48 stands with a varied representation of spruce (i.e., up to 30%, 31%-60%, 61%-90% and over 91%) were analyzed. In each stand, 12 trees were sampled across all social status classes (i.e., sub-dominant, co-dominant and dominant) in detail. Basic dendrometric parameters (such as the total tree height, height of the crown base and stem diameter at breast height) and the amount of the above-ground tree organ biomass (i.e., stem, branches and needles) were investigated. Based on the trends found in the biomass production here and climate change predictions, we recommend that Norway spruce be cultivated only in zones from an altitude of ca 400 m a.s.l., with an annual precipitation of 700 mm and an average annual temperature of 7 degrees C, and its percentage representation in the stand be no more than 30%."
90	Transgenerational effects of water limitation on reproductive mother plants in a common garden of the shrub Frangula alnus	A better understanding of responses to water limitation in woody species can help us to cope with the consequences of the progressing climate change. We focused on the putative transgenerational effects of water limitation in the maternal environment during reproduction. Water was restricted for cuttings of Frangula alnus Mill. in a common garden setting, with a Belgian (local), Italian and Swedish provenance, during the growing season of 2020 and mature berries were collected during the whole reproductive phase. Stones that were extracted from the berries were given a cold stratification. In the next spring, the germination percentage of the stones from the water restricted maternal environment was significantly higher than that of the stones from the normal maternal environment, for the three provenances, notwithstanding the fact that stone weight was not different. The timing of seedling emergence was advanced for the water-limited maternal environment, but only for the stones harvested when mature berry production was the highest (9th and 16th of July 2020). Population differentiation was observed for the timing of seedling emergence, which reflected population differentiation for bud burst of the mother plants in the common garden, including a counter-gradient effect for the Swedish provenance, and corroborating the suggestion that the timing of seedling emergence and leaf phenology may have a common genetic basis. In addition, the Swedish provenance displayed a somewhat more stable germination percentage over the whole berry collection period when the stones were harvested. A partitioning of variance analysis suggested that germination percentage is more genetically determined than timing of seedling emergence, probably reflecting the more important need to sense the environment for an adequate timing of emergence.
91	Invasive plants and agri-food waste extracts as sustainable alternatives for the pre-emergence urban weed control in Portugal central region	The continued use of synthetic herbicides to control weeds leads to environmental pollution and health issues. Consequently, chemical formulations have been increasingly banned. However, sustainable solutions are lacking in the market. Alternatively, valorisation of phytotoxic waste to reduce the herbicides use promotes sustainability, meeting circular economy. We aimed at assessing the herbicidal potential of aqueous extracts of waste from the management of invasive plants (Acacia dealbata bark, Oxalis pes-caprae biomass) and agri-food (spent coffee grounds) on common urban weeds (Achillea ageratum, Conyza canadensis and Dittrichia viscosa) in Portugal. In vitro (paper and soil) and pot assays (soil) were conducted to test the pre-emergence (germination and seedlings) and post-emergence (well-stablished plants) effect of waste extracts on these weeds. Extracts reduced pre-emergence performance of weeds, but marginally affected post-emergence parameters. Germination was inhibited up to 83% by O. pes-caprae in A. ageratum, up to 88% and 87% by A. dealbata and O. pes-caprae in C. canadensis, and up to 70% by concentration in D. viscosa. A. dealbata and O. pes-caprae extracts also drastically reduced radicle length (30% and 55% in A. ageratum, 77% and 81% in C. canadensis, 90% and 92% in D. viscosa, respectively). However, soil neutralized the inhibitory pre-emergence effect. The main findings highlight that the use of A. dealbata and O. pes-caprae extracts as bioherbicides may require an additional synthetic herbicides application, as extracts alone cannot fully control urban weeds in areas without soil. Combining bioherbicides and commercial formulations still reduces the application of toxic chemicals, promoting sustainability.
92	Effect of bioslurry effluent on seedling growth of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L.)	Glasshouse experiments to evaluate the effect of bioslurry effluent on seedling growth of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L) were conducted in summer 2017 and winter 2018 at Dohne Agriculture Development Institute, Stutterheim, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Two cultivars of Swiss chard, Star 1801 and Fordhook giant, were planted in 200 cavity trays using a hygromix commercial growing medium incorporated with fertilizer treatments at different rates of bioslurry: no incorporation (control), 50% bioslurry, 100% bioslurry, 200% bioslurry and the recommended rate of 2:3:4 (30) NPK fertilizers. In the glasshouse the experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) which was replicated three times. At four weeks after germination, ten (10) seedlings per treatment were destructively sampled randomly to determine the plant growth and biological mass parameters: (i) Seedling height, shoot and root height; (ii) Seedling mass; (iii) Fresh shoot and fresh root mass as well as their dry mass; (iv) Nutrient content of leaves. The results indicated that fertilization with 100%Bioslurry produced significantly taller seedlings and shoot height, while the shortest seedlings were obtained from the recommended inorganic fertilizer. Fertilization with 200%Bioslurry and the control treatment produced significantly higher biological yield compared to other treatments. The interaction between fertilizer treatments, cultivar and season indicated that summer season performed better compared to winter in seedling growth and development, and Fordhook giant fertilized with 100% and 200% bioslurry was superior compared to Star 1801. Fertilization with 50% bioslurry resulted in seedlings with higher sodium, while the seedlings grown in the control treatment showed higher copper content. The highest manganese was obtained from the seedlings fertilized with the inorganic fertilizer. It is therefore, concluded that fertilization with bioslurry at 100% and 200% bioslurry application rates enhanced the growth and quality of Swiss chard seedlings.
93	Identification and management of Tomato brown rugose fruit virus in greenhouses in Mexico	Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) has become a cause of great concern in the global tomato agro-industry since its first report in Israel in 2014. Global tomato production is affected by ToBRFV, and management practices are being evaluated. We tested seed lots from international producers as well as greenhouse substrates and water wells as possible sources of virus contamination. We identified a second introduction of ToBRFV in Mexico by a strain closely resembling isolates from the Netherlands and the Middle East. ToBRFV was detected by RT-PCR in seed coats and epicotyls (from commercial seeds and seedlings obtained from infected tomato plants), indicating a transmission rate of 9%. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were found in wells used for irrigation in greenhouses, but these exhibited low infectivity. These findings suggest that water sources could serve as ToBRFV reservoirs. We evaluated four chemical and six thermal methods for sanitizing substrates, plasticware, and other greenhouse utensils, using detached leaf bioassays in Nicotiana rustica. The most effective chemical sanitization method was treatment with glutaraldehyde plus quaternary ammonium salts and pentapotassium salts. The most effective heat treatment was at 92 degrees C for 30 minutes, which inactivated the virus. Tomato producers could implement these sanitization methods to control ToBRFV.
94	Canadian Plant Disease Survey 2023 volume 103: disease highlights 2022	Diseases of berry, vegetable, ornamental nursery and landscape plants in south coastal British Columbia submitted to Elmhirst Diagnostics & Research in 2022 and causal agents are listed. In April - May, cold, wet soils led to nutrient deficiency symptoms on foliage and cool, rainy weather through June led to high levels of botrytis in berries and many other crops. This was followed by hot, dry weather from July-September causing heat and drought stress on many crops and landscape plants. Powdery mildew was severe on many nursery and landscape plants, such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). No significant new diseases were observed.
95	In-silico prediction and in vitro validation of antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal potential of black turmeric (Curcuma Caesia Roxb.) essential oils and its constituents	The growing interest in the health and pharmaceutical industries has led to a significant increase in demand for essential oils. Curcuma caesia, as a member of the Zingiberaceae family, has been used for its high-quality essential oils (EOs) with remarkable therapeutic properties. The current study aimed at predicting the in-silico interactions of C. caesia volatile constituents against the protein responsible for oxidative and microbial stress in order to investigate their potential for industrial and pharmaceutical applications. The accuracy of the in-silico predictions was confirmed by carrying out the in vitro validation of the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activity of the EOs derived from the rhizome and leaves, as well as its volatile constituents. EOs from the rhizome and leaf samples of C. caesia were extracted through the hydro distillation method and yielded a percentage (%) of 1.80 +or- 0.02 and 0.95 +or- 0.02 (fresh weight basis, v/w), respectively. A total of 38 and 29 volatile constituents were identified in the rhizome and leaf EOs by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, representing 92.55% and 90.75% of the total peak area, respectively. The rhizome and leaf EOs showed oxygenated sesquiterpene (39.91% and 27.69%) as the predominate fractions followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (13.36% and 18.44%). Curzerenone (18.09%), epicurzerenone (12.47%), eucalyptol (11.57%), camphor (5.94%), and germacrone (4.47%) were the major constituents in the rhizome EO, whereas, the leaf EO was dominated by eucalyptol (12.53%), camphor (7.23%), curzerenone (5.24%), germacrone (4.81%) and curzerene (4.9%). The in vitro biological activities such as antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal potential of C. caesia EOs were evaluated. The antioxidant evaluation using enzymatic and non-enzymatic assays, showed excellent potential of C. caesia EOs as compared to standard drugs. Specifically, in the enzymatic assay, leaf EO of C. caesia was resulted into the reduction of ROS and an increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in OZ-stimulated PMNs. The EOs also displayed a remarkable antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, elucidating it as the most susceptible strain. Further, the in-silico prediction of the constituents was conducted using Swiss-ADME, and molecular docking analysis. Swiss-ADME revealed the drug-likeness and safety properties of constituents present in C. caesia EOs. The molecular docking study was carried out to interpret the possible interactions of phytoconstituents qualified in the Swiss-ADME study with two bacterial proteins (Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Staphylococcus aureus (PDB ID: 1JIJ) and Glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase from Escherichia coli (PDB ID: 1XFF)), one fungal protein (N-myristoyl transferase from Candida albicans (PDB ID: 1IYL)) and one oxidative protein (Human peroxiredoxin 5 (PDB ID: 1HD2)). Furthermore, to validate the result of molecular docking, the biological activity of higher affinity constituents was also evaluated. As a result, the in vitro findings supported the in-silico prediction. Therefore, C. caesia or its constituents like curzerenone, camphor, eucalyptol, epicurzerenone, germacrone, viridifloral, muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-ol, and globulol might be a valuable source for developing antioxidant and antimicrobial drugs. To the best of present author's knowledge, this is the first scientific report on the in-silico prediction of C. caesia constituents against bacterial, fungal and oxidative proteins through molecular docking, which may contribute to the development of various alternatives against multi-drug resistance.
96	Application of living mulch in rows of the apple trees on several rootstocks - long-term evaluation	The long-term influence of several living mulches on apple tree growth, nutrient status, yield, and fruit quality concerning the year of cover crop sowing in tree rows was evaluated in the Lower Silesia region in the southwestern part of Poland. The estimation was conducted in six apple tree 'Ligol' populations differentiated by the rootstock: M.26, M.9, P 60, P 2, P 16, and P 22. In experiment no. 1, one-year-old nursery stock was planted, and perennial living mulches were sown: colonial bent grass (Agrostis vulgaris With.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in the same year and blue fescue (Festuca ovina L.) in the following year. In experiment no. 2, which involved two-year-old stock, the sowing of blue fescue was delayed until the second, third, fourth, and fifth years following orchard planting. The presence of the cover crop significantly affected young tree growth when one-year-old trees were planted. The sowing of the living mulch in the first or the second year after tree planting led to a significant reduction in the cumulative yield obtained from the young trees. The living mulch improved the red coloration of the fruit skin in the young orchard, but it caused a reduction in the mean fruit weight and size. However, it also contributed to decreased nitrogen concentration in the leaves of the apple trees, and the tree tolerance to living mulch increased as the orchard aged. A choice of semidwarf rootstock, postponed sowing of cover crop, and high-quality nursery stock were recognized as the most important factors for fostering apple tree tolerance to living mulches in tree rows.
97	Leaf chlorophyll contents in some European pear cultivars grafted on different rootstocks and its relation with growth and yield	Aim of study: To investigate the effect of different combinations of pear rootstocks and cultivars on the contents of leaf photosynthetic pigments and their relation with some growth and yield characteristics. Area of study: Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkiye, in two years, 2021 and 2022. Material and methods: The pear cultivars 'Santa Maria', 'Williams', and 'Deveci' were grafted on eight rootstocks: two quince clonal rootstocks (BA29 and QA), five pear clonal rootstocks (FOX9, FOX11, OHxF333, OHxF87, FAROLD40) and Pyrus communis L. seedlings. Growth and yield attributes were calculated and chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were determined by the spectrophotometric method, using 99.8% methanol solvent for chlorophyll (chl) extraction. Main results: Chl a/b in the case of rootstocks, chl a and total carotenoids in the cultivars were found statistically significant; the ratio chl a/b ranged 1.71-2.30 in the case of rootstocks; in the case of cultivars chl a ranged from 17.77 (cv. 'Santa Maria') to 19.88 (cv. 'Deveci') g mL<sup>-1</sup>, and carotenoids ranged 0.21-0.95 g mL<sup>-1</sup>. Under the main impact of cultivars, rootstocks and their combinations, a significant difference was seen in the growth and yield attributes. Research highlights: A negative correlation coefficient was observed between photosynthetic pigments and morphological characteristics; however, the correlation coefficient was positive for canopy volume and annual shoot growth. Canopy management, especially with the use of rootstocks and cultivars that result in weaker growth, is helpful for improving chlorophyll content and yield performances.
98	Yield and quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) depending on variety and type of nitrogen fertilizer	The aim of this research was to determine the effect of the application of different types of nitrogen fertilizer in five different varieties of lettuce on yield. The experiment was performed in the open field, in the spring cycle of growing during 2018 and 2019. The size of the base plot was 3 m2, and the trial was set up in a random block system. The trial covered the application of various forms of nitrogen fertilizers: ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate and urea. The applied nitrogen dose is 100 kg/ha (May 10th 2018 and May 8th 2019). Samples for the analysis of vitamin C and nitrate content, as well as yield determination, were carried out at the stage of the technological maturity of lettuce (60-62 days after seedling). The average weight of lettuce, depending on the variety, varied in the range of 211.3 g to 258.7 g. The use of ammonium nitrate resulted in the highest average weight of lettuce head (246.7 g), followed by the use of urea (238.9 g) and the lowest by the use of ammonium sulphate (221.0 g). The nutritional value of lettuce (vitamin C content) shows that depending on the applied form of nitrogen in the fertilizer, the highest content of vitamin C was determined by urea (10.86 mg/100 g), then ammonium sulphate (9.61 mg/100 g), and the lowest by ammonium nitrate (7.38 mg/100 g). The lower content of vitamin C was found in varieties of lettuce with red leaves compared to varieties with green leaves. The accumulation of nitrate in lettuce leaves directly depends on the variety and the applied fertilizer. The highest nitrate content was with ammonium nitrate (2355.6 mg/kg). The accumulation of nitrate in lettuce varieties with red leaves was higher compared to varieties with green leaves.
99	Balancing nitrogen fertilization in apples: boosting plant growth or European canker?	European canker remains one of the most threatening diseases of apple in countrieswith a temperate climate. The cause of the disease, the fungal pathogen Neonectria ditissima, infects the host through several types of wounds, colonizes the bark tissues, eventually leading to tree death. Nitrogen(N)-containing products are commonly used in apple tree nurseries and orchards to boost plant growth. These products have also been related to an increased level of European canker (Campbell et al., 2018; Dryden et al., 2016; Vorster et al., 2021). This research aimed to determine if the increase of disease is caused by increased activity in N. ditissima growth and germination or by the boosted growth of the trees. Laboratory assays growing isolates on enriched PDA with 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 3% and 5% of urea demonstrated no effect on the hyphal growth or spore germination percentage. Freshly grafted cv. Gala trees were potted in soil supplemented with 0, 50, 150 and 300 kg N/ha over the growing season. The trees were inoculated in the autumn by hanging sporulating cankers above trees or by artificial inoculation of 4 wounds per tree (N = 10). Results were obtained in spring. The percentage of diseased leaf buds when hanging cankers above trees were 2 +or- 1%, 39 +or- 7%, 37 +or- 9% and 61 +or- 10% for the N concentrations of 0, 50, 150 and 300 kg N/ha, respectively. Interestingly, the average canker lesion length on the plants grown with 150 and 300 kg N/ha was 20 +or- 2 mm, about double the size on the trees grown on soil with 0 or 50 kg N/ha. The outcome of this research may help refine the use of nitrogen fertilizer for improved disease management strategies.
100	The application of a molecular assay for early detection of European canker (Neonectria ditissima) in apple trees	Neonectria ditissima causes European canker and is one of the most important fungal diseases of apple trees in countries with a temperate climate. Significant yield losses can occur through girdling of branches and stems, limiting fruit production, eventually leading to tree death. Infections in the propagation and nursery stages can remain asymptomatic for several years after planting. Early detection of these asymptomatic infections could contribute to prevent further development and spread of European canker at a later stage in the orchards. However, to date no fast methods are available. Recently, a molecular assay was developed for the quantification of N. ditissima in asymptomatic wood tissues. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a practical application using the molecular assay for the pre-screening of nursery plant material. Several inoculation experiments were conducted using leaf scars and different concentrations of N. ditissima to gather information necessary for protocol development. The preliminary results presented demonstrate that colonization of N. ditssima can be detected and measured over time and distance up to 30 mm in apple branches and that the measured target DNA concentrations may have predictive power for lesion establishment. The next steps and complexity for implementation of a practical application are discussed. Outcomes of this research may help future research towards detection tools and improved management of European canker.
